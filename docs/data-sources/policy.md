# citrix_policy (Data Source)

~> **Please Note** Each policy can only associate with one policy set. The policy will be created in the default policy set if the policy is not referenced in any of the `policy_ids` of the `citrix_policy_set_v2` resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Get Policy data source by id
data "citrix_policy" "example_policy_data_source_with_id" {
    id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}

# Get Policy data source by name and policy set id
data "citrix_policy" "example_policy_data_source_with_name" {
    policy_set_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    name = "example-policy-set"
}
