- `installed_app_properties` (Attributes) The install application properties. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--installed_app_properties))
- `name` (String) Name of the application.
- `published_name` (String) A display name for the application that is shown to users.

### Optional

- `application_category_path` (String) The application category path allows users to organize and view applications under specific categories in Citrix Workspace App.

- `delivery_groups` (List of String) The delivery group IDs to which the application should be added.

-> **Note** The order of delivery group in the `delivery_groups` list determines the priority of the delivery group. Alternatively, you can use the `delivery_groups_priority` attribute to selectively set the priority of delivery groups.
- `delivery_groups_priority` (Attributes Set) Set of delivery groups with their corresponding priority. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--delivery_groups_priority))
- `description` (String) Description of the application.
