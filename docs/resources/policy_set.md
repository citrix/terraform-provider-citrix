# citrix_policy_set (Resource)

Manages a policy set and the policies within it. The order of the policies specified in this resource reflect the policy priority.

-> **Note** For detailed information about policy settings and filters, please refer to [this document](https://github.com/citrix/terraform-provider-citrix/blob/main/internal/daas/policies/policy_set_resource.md).

~> **Disclaimer** This feature is supported for On-Premises with DDC version `2402` and above and will be made available for Cloud soon.
