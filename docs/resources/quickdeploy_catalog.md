# citrix_quickdeploy_catalog (Resource)

Manages a Citrix Managed Catalog.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Quick Deploy Managed Catalog with Default Power Schedule
resource citrix_quickdeploy_catalog test-1 {
    name = "example-quickdeploy-catalog"
    catalog_type = "MultiSession"
    region = "East US"
    subscription_name = "Citrix Managed"
    template_image_id = "<Template Image ID>"
    machine_size = "d2asv5"
    storage_type = "StandardSSD_LRS"
    number_of_machines = 2
    max_users_per_vm = 4
    power_schedule = {}
}

# Quick Deploy Managed Catalog with custom Power Schedule and custom Machine Naming Scheme
resource citrix_quickdeploy_catalog test-1 {
    name = "example-quickdeploy-catalog-custom-schedule"
    catalog_type = "MultiSession"
    region = "East US"
    subscription_name = "Citrix Managed"
    template_image_id = "<Template Image ID>"
    machine_size = "d2asv5"
    storage_type = "StandardSSD_LRS"
    number_of_machines = 4
    max_users_per_vm = 4
    machine_naming_scheme = {
        naming_scheme = "example-vda-#"
        naming_scheme_type = "Numeric"
    }
    power_schedule = {
        peak_buffer_capacity = 30
        off_peak_buffer_capacity = 15
        peak_min_instances = 2
        off_peak_min_instances = 1
        max_users_per_vm = 4
        weekdays = ["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday"]
        peak_start_time = 9
        peak_end_time = 18
        peak_time_zone_id = "Pacific Standard Time"
        peak_off_delay = 15
    }
}

## Schema

### Required

- `catalog_type` (String) Denotes how the machines in the catalog are allocated to a user. Choose between `MultiSession`, `SingleSessionStatic` and `SingleSessionRandom`.
- `machine_size` (String) The Azure VM SKU to use for creating machines.
- `name` (String) Name of the managed catalog.
- `number_of_machines` (Number) Number of VMs that will be provisioned for this catalog. Defaults to `1`.
- `power_schedule` (Attributes) The power management schedule for the Citrix Managed catalog. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--power_schedule))
- `region` (String) The Azure region to deploy the managed catalog.
- `storage_type` (String) Storage account type used for provisioned virtual machine disks on Azure. Storage types include: `Standard_LRS`, `StandardSSD_LRS` and `Premium_LRS`.
- `template_image_id` (String) The GUID identifier of the template image for creating the managed catalog.

### Optional

- `machine_naming_scheme` (Attributes) Rules specifying how Active Directory machine accounts should be created when machines are provisioned.

~> **Please Note** When importing a `citrix_quickdeploy_catalog` resource, `machine_naming_scheme` must be omitted in the terraform resource body. Explicitly setting it will result in replacing the quick deploy catalog. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--machine_naming_scheme))
- `max_users_per_vm` (Number) Maximum number of concurrent users that could launch session on the same machine. Only allowed to have more than 1 concurrent user when `catalog_type` is `MultiSession`. Defaults to `1`.
- `subscription_name` (String) The name of the Citrix Managed Azure subscription to deploy the managed catalog. Defaults to `Citrix Managed` if omitted.
- `use_managed_disks` (Boolean) Indicate whether to use Azure managed disks for the provisioned virtual machine. Defaults to `true`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) GUID identifier of the managed catalog.

### Nested Schema for `power_schedule`

Optional:

- `off_peak_buffer_capacity` (Number) The percentage of machines in the delivery group that should be kept available in an idle state outside peak hours.
- `off_peak_disconnected_session_action` (String) The action to be performed after a configurable period of a user session disconnecting outside peak hours. Choose between `Nothing`, `Suspend`, and `Shutdown`. Default is `Nothing`.
- `off_peak_disconnected_session_timeout` (Number) The number of minutes before the configured action should be performed after a user session disconnectts outside peak hours.
- `off_peak_extended_disconnect_timeout` (Number) The number of minutes before the second configured action should be performed after a user session disconnects outside peak hours.
- `off_peak_min_instances` (Number) The minimum number of machines that should be powered on during off peak hours. Defaults to `0`. Can only be set to more than `0` if `catalog_type` is `Dedicated`.
- `peak_buffer_capacity` (Number) The percentage of machines in the managed catalog that should be kept available in an idle state in peak hours.
- `peak_disconnected_session_action` (String) The action to be performed after a configurable period of a user session disconnecting in peak hours. Choose between `Nothing`, `Suspend`, and `Shutdown`. Default is `Nothing`.
- `peak_disconnected_session_timeout` (Number) The number of minutes before the configured action should be performed after a user session disconnects in peak hours.
- `peak_end_time` (Number) The end time of peak hours (0-23).
- `peak_extended_disconnect_timeout` (Number) The number of minutes before the second configured action should be performed after a user session disconnects in peak hours.
- `peak_min_instances` (Number) The minimum number of machines that should be powered on during peak hours. Defaults to `0`. Can only be set to more than `0` if `catalog_type` is `Dedicated`.
