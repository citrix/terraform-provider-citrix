StoreFront User Farm Mapping Resource

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "citrix_stf_user_farm_mapping" "example-stf-user-farm-mapping" {
    name = "Example STFUserFarmMapping"
    store_virtual_path = citrix_stf_storeservice.example-stf-store-service.virtual_path
    group_members = [
        {
            group_name = "TestGroup1"
            account_sid = "{First Account Sid}"
        },
        {
            group_name = "TestGroup2"
            account_sid = "{Second Account Sid}"
        }
    ]
    equivalent_farm_sets = [
        {
            name = "EU1",
            aggregation_group_name = "EU1Users"
            primary_farms = ["Primary"]
            backup_farms = ["Backup"]
            load_balance_mode = "LoadBalanced"
            farms_are_identical = true
        },
        {
            name = "EU2",
            aggregation_group_name = "EU2Users"
            primary_farms = ["Secondary"]
            load_balance_mode = "Failover"
            farms_are_identical = false
        }

## Schema

### Required

- `equivalent_farm_sets` (Attributes List) Configurations of the EquivalentFarmSets that will be assigned to the UserFarmMapping. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--equivalent_farm_sets))
- `name` (String) The unique name used to identify the UserFarmMapping.
- `store_virtual_path` (String) The IIS VirtualPath at which the Store is configured to be accessed by Receivers.

### Optional

- `group_members` (Attributes List) The Windows groups to which the UserFarmMapping will apply. Not specifying this field will assign all users to the UserFarmMapping. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--group_members))

### Nested Schema for `equivalent_farm_sets`

Required:

- `aggregation_group_name` (String) The AggregationGroupName used to de-duplicate applications and desktops that are available on multiple EquivalentFarmSets. Where multiple EquivalentFarmSets are defined the AggregationGroup will prevent the user seeing the application multiple times if it exists in both places.
- `load_balance_mode` (String) The load balance mode, either `Failover` or `LoadBalanced`.
- `name` (String) The unique Name used to identify the EquivalentFarmSet.
- `primary_farms` (List of String) The PrimaryFarms. The farm names should match those defined in the Store service.

Optional:

- `backup_farms` (List of String) The BackupFarms. The farm names should match those defined in the Store Service.
- `farms_are_identical` (Boolean) Whether the PrimaryFarms in the EquivalentFarmSet all publish identical resources. Set to true if all resources are identical on all primary farms. Set to false if the deployment has some unique resources per farm. Default to `false`.


<a id="nestedatt--group_members"></a>
### Nested Schema for `group_members`

Required:

- `account_sid` (String) Sid of the account.
- `group_name` (String) A display only group name.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# StoreFront UserFarmMapping can be imported with the Store Virtual Path and UserFarmMapping Name
terraform import citrix_stf_store_service.example-stf-store-service "/Citrix/Store","Example UserFarmMapping"
```
