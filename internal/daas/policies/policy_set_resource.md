Any files this size or larger are cached as soon as possible after logon. To use the cache entire profile feature, set this limit to zero (which caches all of the profile contents).
```

Setting Name: `PSAlwaysCache`

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```

### Always cache size
Description: 
```

### AppData(Roaming) path
Description: 
```
Lets you specify how to redirect the AppData(Roaming) folder. To do so, select Enabled and then type the redirected path.
Caution: Potential data loss might occur. See below for details.
You might want to modify the path after the policy takes effect. However, consider potential data loss before you do so. The data contained in the redirected folder might be deleted if the modified path points to the same location as the previous path.
For example, suppose you specify the Contacts path as path1. Later, you change path1 to path2. If path1 and path2 point to the same location, all data contained in the redirected folder is deleted after the policy takes effect.
To avoid potential data loss, complete the following steps:
1. Apply Microsoft policy to machines where Profile Management is running through Active Directory Group Policy Objects. To do so, open the Group Policy Management Console, navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > File Explorer, and then enable Verify old and new Folder Redirection targets point to the same share before redirecting.
2. If applicable, apply hotfixes to machines where Profile Management is running. For details, see https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/977229 and https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2799904.
```

Use this setting to specify the timeout (in milliseconds) for the session to wait before ending.
```

Setting Name: `ApplicationLaunchWaitTimeout`

Setting Value: `{Timeout in milliseconds}`

### Audio over UDP
Description: 
```
Allow Audio over UDP on the server. The server will open a UDP port, to support all connections which are configured to use Audio over UDP Real-Time Transport. When set to Prohibited, the UDP port will not be opened.
```

Related settings:
```
Audio UDP port range
Audio over UDP real-time transport
```

Setting Name: `UDPAudioOnServer`

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```

### Audio over UDP real-time transport
Description: 
```
Allows transmission of audio between host and client over Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). UDP is best suited for real-time Voice over Internet Protocol activities. UDP transport avoids the lag that can occur with TCP when there is network congestion or packet loss providing real time delivery of the audio data. To use UDP, the audio quality must be set to 'Medium - optimized for speech.'
```

Setting Name: `AllowRtpAudio`

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```

### Audio Plug N Play
Description: 
```
Allows the use of multiple audio devices.
```

Setting Name: `AudioPlugNPlay`

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```

### Audio quality
Description: 
```
Specify the sound quality as low, medium, or high.

Choose 'Low - for low-speed connections' for low-bandwidth connections. Sounds sent to the client are compressed up to 16Kbps. This compression results in a significant decrease in the quality of the sound but allows reasonable performance for a low-bandwidth connection.

Choose 'Medium - optimized for speech' for delivering Voice over IP applications. Audio sent to the client is compressed up to 64Kbps. This compression results in a moderate decrease in the quality of the audio played on the client device, but provides low latency and consumes very low bandwidth. Real-time Transport (RTP) over User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is only supported when this audio quality is selected. Use this audio quality even for delivering media applications over challenging network connections, like very low (less than 512Kbps) lines and when there is congestion and packet loss in the network.

Choose 'High - high definition audio' when delivering media applications. This setting provides high fidelity stereo audio but consumes more bandwidth than the Medium quality setting. Use this setting when network bandwidth is plentiful and sound quality is important.

Bandwidth is consumed only when audio is recording or playing. When both occur at the same time, the bandwidth consumption doubles.
```

```
Audio redirection bandwidth limit

Audio redirection bandwidth limit percent
```

Setting Name: `AudioQuality`

Setting Value: `High`, `Medium`, `Low`

Setting Value Explanation:
Setting Value | Explanation
-- | --

```

Setting Name: `AudioBandwidthLimit`

Setting Value: `{Bandwidth Limit in Kbps}`

### Audio redirection bandwidth limit percent
Description: 
```
Specifies the maximum allowed bandwidth limit for playing or recording audio as a percent of the total session bandwidth.

If you enter a value for this setting and a value for the 'Audio redirection bandwidth limit' setting, the most restrictive setting (with the lower value) is applied.

If you configure this setting, you must also configure the 'Overall session bandwidth limit' setting which specifies the total amount of bandwidth available for client sessions.
```

Related settings:
```
Audio redirection bandwidth limit

Overall session bandwidth limit

Client audio redirection
```

Setting Name: `AudioBandwidthPercent`

Setting Value: `{Percent number of Overall session bandwidth limit allowed for audio}`

### Audio UDP port range
Description: 
```
Range of UDP ports that will be used by the host to exchange audio packet data over RTP with the client. The host will attempt to use a UDP port pair starting from the lowest number port first, incrementing by 2 until it attempts the highest port. Each port will handle both inbound and outbound traffic.

Enter a range in the format (Low port),(High port).

Use client GPO to configure client ports.
```

Setting Name: `RtpAudioPortRange`

Setting Value: `{Port Range in format (Low port),(High port)}`

Example Setting Value: `16500, 16509`

### Auto client reconnect
Description: 
```
Allows or prevents automatic reconnection by the same client after a connection has been interrupted.

Allowing automatic reconnection allows users to resume working where they were interrupted when a connection was broken. Automatic reconnection detects broken connections and then reconnects the users to their sessions.

However, automatic reconnection can result in a new session being launched (instead of reconnecting to an existing session) if a plug-in's cookie, containing the key to the session ID and credentials, is not used. The cookie is not used if it has expired, for example, because of a delay in reconnection, or if credentials must be reentered. Auto Client Reconnect is not triggered if users intentionally disconnect.
```

```
Auto client reconnect authentication
```

Setting Name: `AutoClientReconnect`

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```

### Auto client reconnect authentication
Description: 
```
Requires authentication for automatic client reconnections.

When a user initially logs on to a farm, XenDesktop encrypts and stores the user credentials in memory and creates a cookie containing the encryption key which is sent to the plug-in. When this setting is added, cookies are not used. Instead, XenDesktop displays a dialog box to users requesting credentials when the plug-in attempts to reconnect automatically.
```

Related Settings:
```

```

Setting Name: `AutoClientReconnectAuthenticationRequired`

Setting Value: `RequireAuthentication`, `DoNotRequireAuthentication`

### Auto client reconnect logging
Description: 
```
Records or prevents recording auto client reconnections in the event log. By default, logging is disabled.

When logging is enabled, the server's System log captures information about successful and failed automatic reconnection events. The server farm does not provide a combined log of reconnection events for all servers.
```

Setting Name: `AutoClientReconnectLogging`

Setting Value: `DoNotLogAutoReconnectEvents`, `LogAutoReconnectEvents`

### Auto client reconnect timeout
Description: 
```
Auto client reconnect timeout allows admins to configure the time for which the Receiver will attempt the reconnection through ACR. If Session reliability is also configured with a certain timeout, then the ACR will trigger after the session reliability timeout is over. The maximum allowed ACR Timeout value is 5 minutes.
```

### Automatic migration of existing application profiles
Description: 
```
This setting enables or disables the automatic migration of existing application profiles across different operating systems. The application profiles include both the application data in the AppData folder and the registry entries under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE. This setting can be useful in cases where you want to migrate your application profiles across different operating systems.

For example, suppose you upgrade your operating system (OS) from Windows 10 version 1803 to Windows 10 version 1809. If this setting is enabled, Profile Management automatically migrates the existing application settings to Windows 10 version 1809 the first time each user logs on. As a result, the application data in the AppData folder and the registry entries under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE are migrated.

If there are multiple existing application profiles, Profile Management performs the migration in the following order of priority:
1. Migrates profiles of the same OS type (Desktop OS to Desktop OS and Server OS to Server OS).
2. Migrates profiles of the same Windows OS family; for example, Windows 8 to Windows 8.1, or Windows 10 version 1803 to Windows 10 version 1809.
3. Migrates profiles of an earlier version of the OS; for example, Windows 7 to Windows 10, or Windows Server 2012 to Windows Server 2016.
4. Migrates from the profiles of the closest OS.

Note:You must specify the short name of the operating system by including the variable "!CTX_OSNAME!" in the user store path so that Profile Management can locate the existing application profiles.

If this setting is not configured here, the setting from the .ini file is used.
If this setting is not configured here or in the .ini file, it is disabled by default.

### Browser content redirection
Description: 
```
Controls and optimizes the way Citrix Workspace app delivers web browser content (like HTML5) to users. Only the visible area of the browser where content is displayed (also known as the viewport) is redirected.

By default, this setting is Allowed, and Citrix Workspace app attempts client fetch and client render. If client fetch and client render fails, server-side rendering is attempted. If the browser content redirection proxy configuration setting is also enabled, Citrix Workspace app attempts only server fetch and client render.

System Requirements:
Citrix Receiver for Windows 4.10 minimum to support Internet Explorer 11 viewport redirection.
Citrix Workspace app 1809 for Windows minimum to support Internet Explorer 11 viewport redirection and Google Chrome viewport redirection.
Citrix HDXJsInjector add-on must be enabled on Internet Explorer 11 on the VDA.

The browser content redirection extension (from the Chrome Web Store) must be added and enabled on Google Chrome on the VDA.

### Browser content redirection ACL configuration
Description: 
```
This setting allows you to configure an Access Control List (ACL) of URLs that can use browser content redirection.

Authorized URLs: Specifies the allowed URLs whose content will be redirected to the client.
Wildcard '*' is permitted, however wildcard '*' is not permitted within the protocol of the URL.
For example, http://www.xyz.com/index.html, https://www.xyz.com/*, http://www.xyz.com/*videos*, https://*.xyz.com/*, and https://*.*.xyz.com/* are allowed.
However, http*://www.xyz.com/ is not allowed.
Wildcard '*' after the domain of the URL matches all characters.
Wildcard '*' in the domain of the URL only matches a single domain.
For example, http://*.xyz.com/* matches http://www.xyz.com/index.html but not http://www.abc.xyz.com/index.html or http://www.othersite.com/index.html?abc=www.xyz.com/index.html

Better granularity can be achieved by specifying paths in the URL, for example https://www.xyz.com/sports/index.html. In this case, only index.html page will be redirected.

By default, this setting is set to "https://www.youtube.com/*"

### Browser content redirection authentication sites
Description: 
```
This setting allows you to configure a list of URLs that sites redirected via browser content redirection can use to authenticate a user.

Specifies the URLs for which browser content redirection will remain active (redirected) when navigating from an allowed URL.
Wildcard '*' is permitted, however wildcard '*' is not permitted within the protocol of the URL.
For example, http://www.xyz.com/index.html, https://www.xyz.com/*, http://www.xyz.com/*videos*, https://*.xyz.com/*, and https://*.*.xyz.com/* are allowed.
However, http*://www.xyz.com/ is not allowed.
Wildcard '*' after the domain of the URL matches all characters.
Wildcard '*' in the domain of the URL only matches a single domain.
For example, http://*.xyz.com/* matches http://www.xyz.com/index.html but not http://www.abc.xyz.com/index.html or http://www.othersite.com/index.html?abc=www.xyz.com/index.html

### Browser content redirection block list configuration
Description: 
```
This setting allows you to configure a block list of URLs that cannot use the browser content redirection feature. If a URL is configured via this setting, then the browser content of that URL will not be redirected, but rendered on the server.

This setting works in conjunction with the browser content redirection ACL configuration setting. If URLs are present in both browser content redirection ACL configuration setting and the above block list configuration setting, the block list configuration takes precedence and the browser content of the URL will not be redirected.

Unauthorized URLs: Specifies the blocked URLs whose browser content will not be redirected to the client, but rendered on the server.
Wildcard '*' is permitted, however wildcard '*' is not permitted within the protocol of the URL.
For example, http://www.xyz.com/index.html, https://www.xyz.com/*, http://www.xyz.com/*videos*, https://*.xyz.com/*, and https://*.*.xyz.com/* are allowed.
However, http*://www.xyz.com/ is not allowed.
Wildcard '*' after the domain of the URL matches all characters.
Wildcard '*' in the domain of the URL only matches a single domain.
For example, http://*.xyz.com/* matches http://www.xyz.com/index.html but not http://www.abc.xyz.com/index.html or http://www.othersite.com/index.html?abc=www.xyz.com/index.html

### Browser content redirection integrated Windows authentication support
Description: 
```
Controls browser content redirection (BCR) overlay to use the Negotiate Auth scheme for authentication by using the VDA user's credentials.

When Allowed, the BCR components on the client and on the VDA enable the Overlay to request and obtain a Negotiate ticket from the VDA, which the Overlay provides in response to the authentication challenge.

When Prohibited, the BCR Overlay does not obtain a Negotiate ticket from the VDA.

By default, this setting is Prohibited.

Configuration Requirement:

The Kerberos infrastructure must be configured to issue Kerberos tickets for SPNs (Service Principal Names) constructed from that hostname (e.g. "HTTP/serverhostname.com").

Server-Fetch: When BCR is configured in server-fetch mode, an administrator must ensure that DNS is configured properly on the VDA.

Client-Fetch: When BCR is configured in client-fetch mode, the BCR overlay (running on the client) relies on DNS to resolve hostnames into an IP addresses reachable by the overlay.

### Browser content redirection proxy configuration
Description: 
```
This setting provides configuration options for proxy settings on the VDA for the browser content redirection feature.
If enabled with a valid proxy address:port number, PAC file wpad URL, or Direct/Transparent setting, only server fetch client render is attempted.

If disabled or left unconfigured with default value, client fetch client rendering is attempted.

To configure Server Fetch Client Render, three choices are available once Enabled is selected:

1. Direct or Transparent
Browser content redirection traffic will be routed through the VDA and forwarded directly to the web server hosting the content (e.g. www.youtube.com). The text box should be filled with the keyword "DIRECT" if direct forwarding to a web server is desired.

This setting is designed for scenarios where a Transparent proxy is configured in your environment, or you simply do not have any proxy at all.

2. Explicit Proxy
Browser content redirection traffic will be routed through the VDA and forwarded to the web proxy URL that has been specified in the text box.

Allowed pattern: http://<hostname/ip address>:<port>
For example, http://proxy.example.citrix.com:80 or http://10.0.0.1:8080

3. PAC Files
Browser content redirection traffic will be routed through the VDA and forwarded to the web proxy determined by evaluating the PAC file provided at the URL that has been specified in the text box.
Allowed pattern: http://<hostname/ip address>:<port>/<path>/<Proxy.pac>
For example, http://proxy.example.citrix.com:80/configuration/pac/Proxy.pac
Allowed pattern: http://<hostname/ip address>:<port>/<path>/<wpad.dat>
For example, http://proxy.example.citrix.com:80/configuration/pac/wpad.dat

By default, this setting is prohibited.

### Browser content redirection server fetch proxy auth
Description: 
```
Controls browser content redirection(BCR) so that HTTP traffic originating at the overlay can be routed through web proxies configured to authorize HTTP traffic authenticated with the VDA user's domain credentials via the HTTP “Negotiate” auth scheme.

BCR must be configured for server-fetch in PAC File mode through the browser content redirection proxy configuration setting. The PAC script must provide instructions to route the overlay's traffic through a downstream web proxy. The downstream web proxy must be configured to require authentication of VDA users via the “Negotiate” auth scheme.

When Allowed, if the web proxy responds with a 407 Negotiate challenge (i.e. contains a "Proxy-Authenticate: Negotiate" header), then BCR obtains a Kerberos service ticket by using the VDA user's domain credentials, and includes it in the subsequent request to the web proxy.

When Prohibited, BCR proxies all TCP traffic between the overlay and the web proxy without interfering. Thus, the overlay uses whatever credentials are available to it in order to authenticate to the web proxy (e.g. including basic auth credentials).

By default, this setting is Prohibited.

### Client audio redirection
Description: 
```
Allows or prevents applications hosted on the server to play sounds through a sound device installed on the client computer. Also allows or prevents users to record audio input.

After allowing this setting, you can limit the bandwidth consumed by playing or recording audio. Limiting the amount of bandwidth consumed by audio can improve application performance but may also degrade audio quality. Bandwidth is consumed only while audio is recording or playing. If both occur at the same time, the bandwidth consumption doubles.

To specify the maximum amount of bandwidth, configure the 'Audio redirection bandwidth limit' setting or the 'Audio redirection bandwidth limit percent' setting.

### Client USB device optimization rules
Description: 
```
This setting is available only on VDA versions XenApp and XenDesktop 7.6 Feature Pack 3 and later.

When a user plugins a USB input device, the host checks if the device is allowed by policy. If device is allowed by policy, host further checks the optimization rules for the device. If no rule is specified the device is considered operating in 'Interactive' mode.

The policy rules can be applied to devices to disable optimization or change the optimization mode. The policy rules take the form of 'tag' ='expressions' separated by whitespaces. The following tags are supported:

Mode - The device optimization mode. Refer optimization mode below.
VID - Vendor ID from the device descriptor
PID - Product ID from the device descriptor
REL - Release ID from the device descriptor
Class - Class from either the device descriptor or an interface descriptor
Subclass - Subclass from either the device descriptor or an interface descriptor
Prot - Protocol from either the device descriptor or an interface descriptor

When creating new policy rules, be aware of the following:

* Rules are case-insensitive.
* Values on the right side of the = sign are hex numbers, which may or may not have the leading 0x.
* Rules may have an optional comment at the end, introduced by #.
* Blank and pure comment lines are ignored.
* Tags must use the matching operator =. For example Mode=00000001 VID=1230.
* Refer to the USB class codes available from the USB implementers Forum Inc. Web site.
* The optimization mode is supported for input devices for class=03. Current supported modes are as:

* No Optimization - 00000001
* Interactive Mode - 00000002
* Capture Mode - 00000004

Examples of administrator-defined USB policy rules:

Mode=00000004 VID=1230 PID=1230 class=03 #Input device operating in capture mode
Mode=00000002 VID=1230 PID=1230 class=03 #Input device operating in interactive mode
Mode=00000001 VID=1230 PID=1230 class=03 #Input device operating without any optimization

### Client USB device redirection rules
Description: 
```
Lists redirection rules for USB devices.

When a user plugs in a USB device, the host device checks it against each policy rule in turn until a match is found. The first match for any device is considered definitive. When the first match is an Allow rule, the device is remoted to the virtual desktop. When the first match is a Deny rule, the device is available only to the local desktop. When no match is found, default rules are used. For more information about the default policy configuration for USB devices, see CTX119722, 'Creating USB Policy Rules,' in the Citrix Knowledge Center.

Policy rules take the format (Allow:|Deny:) followed by a set of tag= value expressions separated by whitespace. The following tags are supported:
* VID - Vendor ID from the device descriptor
* PID - Product ID from the device descriptor
* REL - Release ID from the device descriptor
* Class - class from either the device descriptor or an interface descriptor
* SubClass - Subclass from either the device descriptor or an interface descriptor
* Prot - Protocol from either the device descriptor or an interface descriptor

When creating new policy rules, be aware of the following:
* Rules are case-insensitive.
* Rules can have an optional comment at the end, introduced by #.
* Blank and pure comment lines are ignored.
* Tags must use the matching operator =. For example, VID=1230.
* Each rule must start on a new line or form part of a semicolon-separated list.
* See the USB class codes available from the USB Implementers Forum, Inc. website.

### Client USB device redirection rules (Version 2) 
Description: 
```
Specifies rules for filtering, splitting and auto-connecting USB devices to a remote session.

When this setting is selected, the host overrides the setting - 'Client USB device redirection rules' with device rules configured in this setting.

The device rules are an ordered list of case insensitive rules terminated by newlines or semicolon, where:
- anything after "#" is line comment
- each rule is:
(CONNECT | ALLOW | DENY | FORCEDENY): (filters)* (split/intf) (attributes)*

- (filters)* are a series of zero or more USB device selector key/value pairs:
(vid | pid | rel) = (xxxx | *) or (class | subclass | prot) = (xx | *), where
xxxx is a 4-digit hex number. xx is a 2-digit hex number. * matches any value.
if unspecified, default is * [match any]

- (split/intf) is an optional directive to split and select interfaces of a composite USB device:
split=(0 | 00 | f | false | 1 | 01 | t | true)
intf=* or intf=(xx(,xx)*)
if unspecified, default is "split=0 intf=*"
Example: split=01 intf=00,02,03 # split and apply to three interfaces

- (attributes)* is an optional list of attributes key/value pairs
Example: Mode=1 ConnectNew=1 ConnectExisiting=0

The rules configured in this setting override the client-side GPO and the defaults. The sole exception to this is the FORCEDENY rule, which can be used in the client-side to override an ALLOW/CONNECT rule configured in this DDC setting.

The default value for the device rules is:
# Block some devices we never want to see
DENY: vid=17e9 # All DisplayLink USB displays
DENY:vid=045e pid=079A # Microsoft Surface Pro 1 Touch Cover
DENY:vid=045e pid=079c # Microsoft Surface Pro 1 Type Cover
DENY:vid=045e pid=07dc # Microsoft Surface Pro 3 Type Cover

### Concurrent logons tolerance
Description: 
```
Define the expected number of concurrent logons for a server.
```

Setting Name: `ConcurrentLogonsTolerance`

Related Settings:
```
Maximum number of sessions

CPU usage

Disk usage

Memory usage

Memory usage base load
```

Setting Value: `{Expected number off concurrent logons for a server}`

### Contacts path
Description: 
```
Lets you specify how to redirect the Contacts folder. To do so, select Enabled and then type the redirected path.
Caution: Potential data loss might occur. See below for details.
You might want to modify the path after the policy takes effect. However, consider potential data loss before you do so. The data contained in the redirected folder might be deleted if the modified path points to the same location as the previous path.
For example, suppose you specify the Contacts path as path1. Later, you change path1 to path2. If path1 and path2 point to the same location, all data contained in the redirected folder is deleted after the policy takes effect.
To avoid potential data loss, complete the following steps:
1. Apply Microsoft policy to machines where Profile Management is running through Active Directory Group Policy Objects. To do so, open the Group Policy Management Console, navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > File Explorer, and then enable Verify old and new Folder Redirection targets point to the same share before redirecting.
2. If applicable, apply hotfixes to machines where Profile Management is running. For details, see https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/977229 and https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2799904.
```

Setting Value: `{CPU Usage Percentage Value to Report Full Load}`

### CPU usage excluded process priority
Description: 
```
It is quite common for background processes to run when a server is deemed idle and to consume all CPU that is not required by other active processes on the server. One way of achieving this is for a background process to run at a process priority that is below Normal, i.e. 'Below Normal' or 'Low'. If a new user session were to be established on a server when a background process was consuming CPU, the Windows Operating System scheduler would attempt to withdraw as much CPU from background process as necessary to fulfill the demands of the processes from the new user session. This setting allows the CPU usage associated with background processes to be excluded from the CPU Usage load calculation.

If the CPU Usage setting is disabled, then this setting will be ignored irrespective of its configuration.
```

Setting Name: `CPUUsageExcludedProcessPriority`

```

### Customize storage path for VHDX files
Description: 
```
Applies to: both file-based and container-based profile solutions

By default, Profile Management stores VHDX files in the user store. With this policy enabled, you can specify a separate path to store VHDX files.

Policies that use VHDX files include the following: Profile container, Search index roaming for Outlook, and Accelerate folder mirroring. VHDX files of different policies are stored in different folders under the storage path.
```

Setting Name: `VhdStorePath_Part`

Setting Value: `{Path to store VHDX files}`

### Customized User Layer Size in GB

If this policy is not configured either here or in the .ini file, the default is 50 (GB).
```

Setting Name: `VhdContainerCapacity_Part`

Setting Value: `{Default storage capacity (in GB) of VHD containers}`

### Default printer
Description: 
```
Specifies how the client's default printer is established in an ICA session. By default, the client's current printer is used as the default printer for the session.

ClientDefault: 'Set default printer to the client's main printer' allows the client's current default printer to be used as the default printer for the session.

GenericUniversalPrinter: 'Set default printer to the Generic Universal printer' allows the Generic Universal printer to be used as the default printer for the session.

PDFPrinter: 'Set default printer to the PDF printer' allows the PDF printer to be used as the default printer for the sessions using the the Citrix Workspace App for HTML5 or Chrome.

DoNotAdjust: 'Do not adjust the user's default printer' uses the current Terminal Services or Windows user profile setting for the default printer. If you choose this option, the default printer is not saved in the profile and it does not change according to other session or client properties. The default printer in a session will be the first printer auto-created in the session, which is either:

* The first printer added locally to the Windows server in Control Panel > Printers
* The first auto-created printer, if there are no printers added locally to the server

You can use this option to present users with the nearest printer through profile settings (known as Proximity Printing).

When policy settings are resolved, the default printer applied by this setting is overridden by a default printer applied by the 'Printer assignments' setting.

Use individual 'Default printers' policies to set default behaviors for a farm, site, large group, or OU. Use the 'Printer assignments' setting to assign a large group of printers to multiple users.
```

Setting Name: `DefaultClientPrinter`

Setting Value: `ClientDefault`, `DoNotAdjust`, `GenericUniversalPrinter`, `PDFPrinter`

### Delay before deleting cached profiles
Description: 
```
Applies to: file-based profile solution only

Works only if 'Delete locally cached profiles on logoff' is enabled. Sets an optional extension to the delay before locally cached profiles are deleted at logoff. A value of 0 deletes the profiles immediately during logoff processing. Checks take place every minute, so a value of 60 ensures that profiles are deleted between one and two minutes after users have logged off (depending on when the last check took place). Extending the delay is useful if you know that a process keeps files or the user registry hive open during logoff. With large profiles, this can also speed up logoff.

If this policy is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used.

If this policy is not configured here or in the .ini file, profiles are deleted immediately.
```

Setting Name: `ProfileDeleteDelay_Part`

Setting Value: `{Delay time in seconds}` 

### Delete locally cached profiles on logoff
Description: 
```
Applies to: file-based profile solution only

Specifies whether locally cached profiles are deleted after logoff.

If this setting is enabled, a user's local profile cache is deleted after they have logged off. This is recommended for terminal servers.

If this setting is disabled cached profiles are not deleted.

If this setting is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used.

If this setting is not configured here or in the .ini file, cached profiles are not deleted.
```

Setting Name: `DeleteCachedProfilesOnLogoff`

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```

### Desktop launches

```

### Directories to synchronize
Description: 
```
Applies to: file-based profile solution only

Profile management synchronizes each user's entire profile between the system it is installed on and the user store.

It allows you to include subfolders of excluded folders.

Paths on this list should be relative to the user profile.

Wildcards are supported but they are not applied recursively.

Examples:
Desktop\exclude\include specifies the include subfolder of the Desktop\exclude folder.

Desktop\exclude\* specifies all immediate subfolders of the Desktop\exclude folder.

Disabling this setting has the same effect as enabling it and configuring an empty list.

If this setting is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used.

If this setting is not configured here or in the .ini file, only non-excluded folders in the user profile are synchronized.
```

Setting Name: `SyncDirList_Part`

Setting Value: 
```

### Disable defragmentation for VHD disk compaction
Description: 
```
Applies to: both file-based and container-based profile solutions

Lets you specify whether to disable file defragmentation for VHD disk compaction.

When VHD disk compaction is enabled, the VHD disk file is first automatically defragmented using the Windows built-in 'defrag' tool, and then compacted. VHD disk defragmentation produces better compaction results while disabling it can save system resources.

If this policy is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used.

If this policy is not configured here or in the .ini file, the defragmentation is enabled by default.

```

### Enable asynchronous processing for user Group Policy on logon
Description: 
```
Applies to: both file-based and container-based profile solutions

Windows provides two processing modes for user Group Policy: synchronous and asynchronous. Windows uses a registry value to determine the processing mode for the next user logon. If the registry value doesn't exist, synchronous mode is applied. The registry value is a machine-level setting and doesn't roam with users. Thus, asynchronous mode will not be applied as expected if users:
Log on to different machines.
Log on to the same machine where the Delete locally cached profiles on logoff policy is enabled.

With this policy enabled, Citrix Profile Management lets the registry value roam with users. As a result, processing mode is applied each time users log on.

For asynchronous mode to take effect on Windows Server machines, make sure that you install the Remote Desktop Session Host role and set the Group Policies as follows:
Computer Config | Admin Templates | System | Logon | Always wait for the network at computer startup and logon: Disabled
Computer Config | Admin Templates | System | Group Policy | Allow asynchronous user Group Policy processing when logging on through Remote Desktop Services: Enabled
```

Setting Name: `SyncGpoStateEnabled`

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```

```

### Enable Citrix Virtual Apps Optimization
Description: 
```
Applies to: file-based profile solution only

When you enable this feature, only the settings specific to the published applications a user launches or exits are synchronized.

If this setting is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used.

If this setting is not configured here or in the .ini file, no Citrix Virtual Apps optimization settings will be applied.
```

Setting Name: `XenAppOptimizationEnabled`

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```

### Enable concurrent session support for Outlook search data roaming
Description: 
```
Applies to: both file-based and container-based profile solutions

Provides native Outlook search experience in concurrent sessions. Use this policy with the Search index roaming for Outlook policy.

With this policy enabled, each concurrent session uses a separate Outlook OST file.

By default, only two VHDX disks can be used to store Outlook OST files (one file per disk). If more sessions start, their Outlook OST files are stored in the local user profiles. You can specify the maximum number of VHDX disks for storing Outlook OST files.

Example:
You set the number to 3. As a result, Profile Management stores Outlook OST files on the VHDX disks for the first, second, and third concurrent sessions. It stores the OST file for the fourth concurrent session in the local profile instead.
```

Setting Name: `OutlookSearchRoamingConcurrentSession`

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```

### Enable credential-based access to user stores
Description: 
```
Applies to: both file-based and container-based profile solutions

By default, Profile Management impersonates the current user to access user stores. Therefore, it requires the current user to have permission to directly access the user stores. Enable this feature if you do not want Profile Management to impersonate the current user when accessing user stores. You can put user stores in storage repositories (for example, Azure Files) that the current user has no permission to access.

To ensure that Profile Management can access user stores, save the profile storage server's credentials in Workspace Environment Management or Windows Credential Manager. We recommend that you use Workspace Environment Management to eliminate the need to configure the same credentials for each machine where Profile Management runs. If you use Windows Credential Manager, use the Local System account to securely save the credentials.

Note: Starting with Profile Management version 2212, this feature is available for both file-based and VHDX-based Profile Management solutions. For Profile Management versions earlier than 2212, this feature is available only for the VHDX-based Profile Management solution.

If this setting is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used. If this setting is configured neither here nor in the .ini file, it is disabled by default.
```

### Enable multi-session write-back for profile containers
Description: 
```
Applies to: both file-based and container-based profile solutions

Enables write-back for profile containers in multi-session scenarios. If enabled, changes in all sessions are written back to profile containers. Otherwise, only changes in the first session are saved because only the first session is in read/write mode in profile containers. Citrix Profile Management profile containers are supported starting with Citrix Profile Management 2103. FSLogix Profile Container is supported starting with Citrix Profile Management 2003.

To use this policy for FSLogix Profile Container, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

```

Setting Name: `OutlookSearchRoamingEnabled`

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```

### Enable session watermark
Description: 
```
Controls the way in which ICA session content is displayed.

When this setting is enabled, session display will be watermarked by an extra layer of semi-transparent text labels containing session-specific information (logon username, VDA host name etc).

Session watermark serves as a deterrent method in scenarios where a malicious session end user might leak sensitive information by taking pictures or screenshots of the session display. This policy can be enabled if some level of deterrence is prefered while sensitive information are displayed in the ICA session, and the administrator should be fully aware of the impact to user experience.

By default, session watermark is disabled.

Note:
Session watermark should not be regarded as a complete security protection mechanism by itself, combine it with other security solutions whenever it is possible.

Measures should be taken to ensure the integrity of Citrix components on VDA and client machines, otherwise session watermark may not function properly.

Effectiveness of watermark protection varies according to session conditions. It might not provide effective protection under certain usage scenario.

Watermark labels on pictures and screenshots taken from a session could be removed, distorted, modified or falsified using a variety of methods.

Watermark information are for reference only and should not be used for any legal purpose, nor should it be viewed as a reliable source for tracking data leakage.

Enabling session watermark can bring negative effect to the end user experience of the session. Adminstrator can adjust the watermark style related settings to achieve a balance between deterrence effect and user experience.

For a complete list of recommendations on using this feature, refer to Citrix Knowledge Base.
```

Setting Name: `EnableSessionWatermark`

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```

### Enable Unicode keyboard layout mapping
Description: 
```
Setting provides VDA-side support for Unicode keyboard layout mapping. This setting resolves incorrect input key mapping, which might occur in a non-Windows Citrix Workspace app. Incorrect input key mapping occurs because the mechanism of the non-Windows client keyboard layout is different with VDAs.
Note:
We are phasing out these registry settings in the Windows VDA -
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Citrix\CtxKlMap\EnableKlMap value = DWORD 1
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Citrix\CtxKlMap\DisableWindowHook value = DWORD 1
```

Setting Name: `EnableUnicodeKeyboardLayoutMapping`

```

Setting Name: `EnableVHDDiskCompaction`

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```

### Enhanced Desktop Experience
Description: 
```
The Enhanced Desktop Experience feature configures Server OSs to deliver remote desktops which look as close as possible to Client OSs.

Note the following caveats:

If a user profile with Windows Classic theme already exists, then enabling this policy does not provide Enhanced Desktop Experience for that user.

If users with a user profile of Windows 7 theme logon to Windows Server 2012, for which this setting is either not configured or disabled, an error message is shown to the user. This error message indicates a failure to apply the theme.

In both above cases, resetting the user profile resolves the issue.

If this setting switches from enabled state to disabled state on a Server OS that has active user sessions, the look and feel for those sessions is inconsistent with Windows 7 and Windows Classic desktop experience.

After switching from enabled state to disabled state on a TS VDA, reboot the VDA. It is mandatory to delete the roaming profiles after such a switch. If other user profiles exist on the VDA, it is advisable to delete the same to avoid inconsistencies.

If roaming profiles are being used, all the Server OSs should have the Enhanced Desktop Experience feature either enabled or disabled site-wide.

The sharing of roaming profiles between Server OSs and Client OSs is discouraged as it causes inconsistency in the profile properties.
```

Setting Name: `EnhancedDesktopExperience`

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```

### Enhanced domain passthrough for single sign on
Description: 
```

### Favorites path
Description: 
```
Applies to: file-based profile solution only

Lets you specify how to redirect the Favorites folder. To do so, select Enabled and then type the redirected path.
Caution: Potential data loss might occur. See below for details.
You might want to modify the path after the policy takes effect. However, consider potential data loss before you do so. The data contained in the redirected folder might be deleted if the modified path points to the same location as the previous path.
For example, suppose you specify the Contacts path as path1. Later, you change path1 to path2. If path1 and path2 point to the same location, all data contained in the redirected folder is deleted after the policy takes effect.
To avoid potential data loss, complete the following steps:
1. Apply Microsoft policy to machines where Profile Management is running through Active Directory Group Policy Objects. To do so, open the Group Policy Management Console, navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > File Explorer, and then enable Verify old and new Folder Redirection targets point to the same share before redirecting.
2. If applicable, apply hotfixes to machines where Profile Management is running. For details, see https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/977229 and https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2799904.

### Files to exclude in profile container
Description: 
```
Applies to: both file-based and container-based profile solutions

List of files to exclude from the profile container.

Specify files to exclude in the form of relative paths to the user profile. You can use wildcards. Wildcards in file names are applied recursively while wildcards in folder names are not. You can use the vertical bar (|) to restrict the policy only to the current folder so that the policy does not apply to the subfolders.

If this setting is disabled, no files are excluded.

If this setting is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used.

If this setting is configured neither here nor in the .ini file, no files are excluded.

Examples:
Desktop\Desktop.ini excludes the file Desktop\Desktop.ini from the profile container.

AppData\*.tmp excludes all files with the extension .tmp in the directory AppData and its subfolders.

AppData\*.tmp| excludes all files with the extension .tmp in the directory AppData.

Downloads\*\a.txt excludes a.txt in any immediate subfolder of the Downloads folder. Note that wildcards in folder names are not applied recursively.
```

Setting Name: `ProfileContainerExclusionListFile_Part`

Setting Value:
```
jsonencode([
    {File Path 1},
    {File Path 2},
    ...
])
```

### Files to include in profile container
Description: 
```
Applies to: both file-based and container-based profile solutions

List of files to include in the profile container when their parent folders are excluded from it.

Specify files to include in the form of relative paths to the user profile. You can use wildcards. Wildcards in file names are applied recursively while wildcards in folder names are not. You can use the vertical bar (|) to restrict the policy only to the current folder so that the policy does not apply to the subfolders.

Disabling this setting has the same effect as enabling it and configuring an empty list.

If this setting is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used.

If this setting is configured neither here nor in the .ini file, folders not on the exclusion list are included in the profile container.

Examples:
AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\Access.qat includes a file under a folder excluded in the default configuration.

AppData\Local\MyApp\*.cfg includes all files with the extension .cfg in the profile folder AppData\Local\MyApp and its subfolders.

AppData\Local\MyApp\*.cfg| includes all files with the extension .cfg in the profile folder AppData\Local\MyApp.

Downloads\*\b.txt includes b.txt in any immediate subfolder of the Downloads folder. Note that wildcards in folder names are not applied recursively.
```

Setting Name: `ProfileContainerInclusionListFile_Part`

Setting Value:
```
jsonencode([
    {File Path 1},
    {File Path 2},
    ...
])
```

### Files to include in the shared store for deduplication
Description: 
```
Applies to: both file-based and container-based profile solutions

Identical files can exist in various user profiles. Separating those files from the user store and storing them in a central location can save storage space. Doing so avoids duplicates. This policy lets you specify files that you want to include in the shared store on the server hosting the user store. With the policy enabled, Profile Management generates the shared store automatically. It then centrally stores the specified files in the shared store rather than in each user profile in the user store.

Starting with Profile Management version 2311, this policy applies to profile containers.

Specify the file names with paths relative to the user profile. Consider the following:

- Wildcards are supported.

- Wildcards in file names are applied recursively. To restrict them only to the current folder, use the vertical bar (|).

- Wildcards in folder names are not applied recursively.

Examples:

- Downloads\profilemgt_x64.msi specifies the profilemgt_x64.msi file in the Downloads folder.

- *.cfg specifies files with the .cfg extension in the user profile folder and its subfolders.

- Music\* specifies files in the Music folder and its subfolders.

- Downloads\*.iso specifies files with the .iso extension in the Downloads folder and its subfolders.

- Downloads\*.iso| specifies files with the .iso extension only in the Downloads folder.

- AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneDrive\*\*.dll specifies files with the .dll extension in any immediate subfolder of the AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneDrive folder.

If this setting is disabled, the shared store is disabled.
If this setting is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used.
If this setting is configured neither here nor in the .ini file, the shared store is disabled.
```

Setting Name: `SharedStoreFileInclusionList_Part`

Setting Value:
```
jsonencode([
    {File Path 1},
    {File Path 2},
    ...
])
```

### Files to synchronize
Description: 
```
Applies to: file-based profile solution only

Profile management synchronizes each user's entire profile between the system it is installed on and the user store.

This setting allows for the inclusion of files below excluded folders.

Paths on this list should be relative to the user profile. Wildcards are allowed. Wildcards in file names are applied recursively while wildcards in folder names are not.

Note: As of Profile Management 7.15, you can use the vertical bar '|' for applying a policy to only the current folder without propagating it to the subfolders.

Examples:
AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\Access.qat specifies a file below a folder excluded in the default configuration.

AppData\Local\MyApp\*.cfg specifies all files with the extension .cfg in the profile folder AppData\Local\MyApp and its subfolders.

AppData\Local\MyApp\*.cfg| specifies all files with the extension .cfg in the profile folder AppData\Local\MyApp.

Downloads\*\b.txt specifies b.txt in any immediate subfolder of the Downloads folder. Note that wildcards in folder names are not applied recursively.

Disabling this setting has the same effect as enabling it and configuring an empty list.

If this setting is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used.

If this setting is not configured here or in the .ini file, only non-excluded files in the user profile are synchronized.
```

Setting Name: `SyncFileList_Part`

Setting Value:
```
jsonencode([
    {File Path 1},
    {File Path 2},
    ...
])
```

    ...
])
```

### Folders to mirror
Description: 
```
Applies to: file-based profile solution only

Profile management can mirror a folder relative to the profile's root folder. Use this setting for files whose contents index data and where separate instances of the data are likely to exist. For example, you can mirror the Internet Explorer cookies folder so that index.dat is synchronized with the cookies that it indexes. Be aware that, in these situations the "last write wins" so files in mirrored folders that have been modified in more than one session are overwritten by the last update, resulting in loss of profile changes.
```

Setting Name: `MirrorFoldersList_Part`

Setting Value:
```
jsonencode([
    {Folder Path 1},
    {Folder Path 2},
    ...
])

### HDX adaptive transport
Description: 
```
Adaptive transport is a network-aware data transport engine that provides efficient, reliable, and consistent congestion and flow control.

By default, adaptive transport is set to Preferred, data transport takes place over a proprietary transport protocol, Enlightened Data Transport (EDT), that is built on top of UDP, with automatic fallback to TCP. Additional configuration is not required to optimize for LAN, WAN, or Internet conditions. Citrix's transport protocol responds to changing conditions.

When set to Off, adaptive transport is disabled and TCP is used. Recommended when using SD-WAN WAN optimization, which provides cross-session tokenized compression, since WAN optimization has its own congestion and flow control.

Setting Diagnostic mode forces EDT on and disables fallback to TCP. Recommended for testing purposes only.

None of these settings affects other services that depend on UDP transport, such as UDP Audio and Framehawk.
```

Setting Name: `HDXAdaptiveTransport`

Setting Value: `Off`, `Preferred`, `DiagnosticMode`

The ICA round trip is the time interval, measured at the client device, between the first action a user takes (such as typing the letter 'A') and the result of that action (such as the graphical display of the letter 'A').

By default, each ICA roundtrip measurement initiation is delayed until some traffic occurs that indicates user interaction. This delay can be indefinite in length and is designed to prevent the ICA roundtrip measurement being the sole reason for ICA traffic. To perform round trip calculations regardless of user activity level, configure the 'ICA round trip calculations for idle connections' setting.

To set the interval at which calculations occur, configure the 'ICA round trip calculation interval' setting.
```

Setting Name: `IcaRoundTripCalculation`

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false

You might want to modify the path after the policy takes effect. However, consider potential data loss before you do so. The data contained in the redirected folder might be deleted if the modified path points to the same location as the previous path.
For example, suppose you specify the Contacts path as path1. Later, you change path1 to path2. If path1 and path2 point to the same location, all data contained in the redirected folder is deleted after the policy takes effect.
To avoid potential data loss, complete the following steps:
1. Apply Microsoft policy to machines where Profile Management is running through Active Directory Group Policy Objects. To do so, open the Group Policy Management Console, navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > File Explorer, and then enable Verify old and new Folder Redirection targets point to the same share before redirecting.
2. If applicable, apply hotfixes to machines where Profile Management is running. For details, see https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/977229 and https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2799904.

```

Setting Name: `LogonExclusionCheck_Part`

Setting Value: `Disable`, `Ignore`, `Delete`

### Loss tolerant mode
Description: 
```
Loss tolerant mode is designed to maintain usable session interactivity over a network connection with high packet loss and latency.

To maintain an interactive session, it trades off both image quality and bandwidth usage.

When available, the mode is entered only when packet loss and latency are above a threshold, which by default is set high enough to only be triggered when incurring the overhead is necessary to maintain interactivity. The default threshold can be overridden by using loss tolerant mode thresholds.
```

Setting Name: `LossTolerantModeAvailable`

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```

### Loss tolerant mode for audio
Description: 
```
Loss tolerant mode for audio is optimized for real-time communication and performs better over networks with packet loss and high latency.

The HDX adaptive transport setting must be set to Preferred for this setting to be applied.
```

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```

### Loss tolerant mode thresholds
Description: 
```
Specifies the network metrics thresholds at which the session switches to loss tolerant mode if it is available. The session will go into loss tolerant mode and remain there as long as each of the thresholds is exceeded.

The default thresholds are as follows:
• Packet loss threshold: 5 %
• Latency threshold: 300 ms rtt
```

Setting Name: `LossTolerantThresholds`

Setting Value: `loss,{Loss Threshold};latency,{Latency Threshold};`

### LPT port redirection bandwidth limit
Description: 
```
For VDA versions that do not support this setting, follow CTX139345 to enable redirection using the registry.

Specifies the maximum allowed bandwidth in kilobits per second for print jobs using an LPT port in a single client session.

If you enter a value for this setting and a value for the 'LPT port redirection bandwidth limit percent' setting, the most restrictive setting (with the lower value) is applied.
```

Setting Name: `LptBandwidthLimit`

Related Settings:
```
LPT port redirection bandwidth limit percent

Client LPT port redirection
```

Setting Value: `{Bandwidth Limit in Kbps}`

### LPT port redirection bandwidth limit percent
Description: 
```
For VDA versions that do not support this setting, follow CTX139345 to enable redirection using the registry.

Specifies the bandwidth limit for print jobs using an LPT port in a single client session as a percent of the total session bandwidth.

If you enter a value for this setting and a value for the 'LPT port redirection bandwidth limit (Kbps)' setting, the most restrictive setting (with the lower value) is applied.

If you configure this setting, you must also configure the 'Overall session bandwidth limit' setting which specifies the total amount of bandwidth available for client sessions.
```

Setting Name: `LptBandwidthLimitPercent`

Related Settings:
```
LPT port redirection bandwidth limit

Overall session bandwidth limit

Client LPT port redirection
```

Setting Value: `{Bandwidth Limit Percentage Value}`

### Max Speex quality
Description: 
```
This setting is supported only by Linux Virtual Desktop 1.4 and onwards.

Audio redirection encodes audio data with Speex codec when the Audio quality setting is set to medium or low. Speex is a lossy codec, which means that it achieves compression at the expense of fidelity of the input speech signal. Unlike some other speech codecs, it is possible to control the tradeoff made between quality and bit-rate. The Speex encoding process is controlled most of the time by a quality parameter that ranges from 0 to 10. The higher the quality, the higher the bit-rate.

This setting sets the best Speex quality to encode audio data specified by the Audio redirection bandwidth limit setting. If the Audio quality setting is set to medium, the encoder is in wide band mode, which means higher sampling rate. If the Audio quality setting is set to low, the encoder is in narrow band mode, which means lower sampling rate. The same Speex quality has different bit-rate in different mode. The best Speex quality is the largest value that meets the following conditions:

* It is equal to or less than the max Speex quality
* Its bit-rate is equal to or less than the bandwidth limit
```

Setting Name: `MaxSpeexQuality`

Setting Value: `{Max Speex Quality}`

### Maximum allowed color depth

### Maximum number of VHDX disks for storing Outlook OST files
Description: 
```
Applies to: both file-based and container-based profile solutions

Provides native Outlook search experience in concurrent sessions. Use this policy with the Search index roaming for Outlook policy.

With this policy enabled, each concurrent session uses a separate Outlook OST file.

By default, only two VHDX disks can be used to store Outlook OST files (one file per disk). If more sessions start, their Outlook OST files are stored in the local user profiles. You can specify the maximum number of VHDX disks for storing Outlook OST files.

Example:
You set the number to 3. As a result, Profile Management stores Outlook OST files on the VHDX disks for the first, second, and third concurrent sessions. It stores the OST file for the fourth concurrent session in the local profile instead.
```

Setting Name: `OutlookSearchRoamingConcurrentSession_Part`

Setting Value: `{Maximum VHDX Disks Count}`

### Maximum size of the log file
Description: 
```
Applies to: both file-based and container-based profile solutions

Sets the maximum size of the log file in bytes. If the log file grows beyond this size an existing backup of the file (.bak) is deleted, the log file is renamed to .bak, and a new log file is created.

The log file is created in "%SystemRoot%\System32\Logfiles\UserProfileManager" or in the location specified by the "Path to log file" policy setting.

If this setting is disabled, the default value of 10 MB is used.

If this setting is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used.

If this setting is not configured here or in the .ini file, the default of 10 MB is used.
```

Setting Name: `MaxLogSize_Part`

Setting Value: `{Maximum Log File Size in Bytes}`

### Memory usage
Description: 
```
Defines the memory usage percentage value at which the server reports full load.
```

Setting Name: `MemoryUsage`

Setting Value: `{Memory Usage Percentage Value to Report Full Load}`

### Memory usage base load
Description: 
```
A significant portion of memory may be required for base operating system functions, i.e. before any sessions have started. This setting is an approximation of the base operating system's memory usage and defines the memory usage in MBs below which a server is considered to have zero load.

If the Memory Usage setting is disabled, then this setting will be ignored irrespective of its configuration.

In most installations the default value should be adequate. However, if the server has limited memory, for example 2GBs in a Proof of Concept environment, the value may need to be tuned to more closely reflect the memory usage of the operating system.
```

Setting Name: `MemoryUsageBaseLoad`

Setting Value: `{Memory Usage Value in MBs to Report Zero Load}`

### Menu animation
Description: 
```
Allows or prevents menu animation. By default, menu animation is allowed.

Menu animation is a Microsoft personal preference setting that causes a menu to appear after a short delay, either by scrolling or fading in. When allowed, an arrow icon appears at the bottom of the menu; the menu appears when you mouse over that arrow.
```

Setting Name: `MenuAnimation`

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```

### Microsoft Teams redirection
Description: 
```
Controls and optimizes the way Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops servers deliver Microsoft Teams multimedia content to users.

Only multimedia content is redirected to the user's client machine, where it is decoded locally, effectively offloading all CPU, RAM, GPU, I/O, and bandwidth processing from the VDA to the endpoint.

In addition to this policy, the appropriate version of Citrix Workspace app is required for Microsoft Teams redirection to occur.

For more information and troubleshooting, see Knowledge Center article CTX253754.

When clicking on Help / Report a Problem in Microsoft Teams, logs will be automatically shared between Citrix and Microsoft in order to resolve technical issues.
```

Setting Name: `MSTeamsRedirection`

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```

### Migrate user store
Description: 
```
Applies to: file-based profile solution only

Specifies the path to the folder where the user settings (registry changes and synchronized files) were previously saved (the user store path that you previously used).

If this setting is configured, the user settings stored in the previous user store are migrated to the current user store specified in the "Path to user store" policy setting.

The path can be an absolute UNC path or a path relative to the home directory.

In both cases, you can use the following types of variables: system environment variables enclosed in percent signs and attributes of the Active Directory user object enclosed in hash signs.

Examples:
The folder Windows\%ProfileVer% stores the user settings in the subfolder called Windows\W2k3 of the user store (if %ProfileVer% is a system environment variable resolving to W2k3).

\\server\share\#SAMAccountName# stores the user settings to the UNC path \\server\share\JohnSmith (if #SAMAccountName# resolves to JohnSmith for the current user).

You can use user environment variables except %username% and %userdomain%.

If this setting is disabled, the user settings are still saved in the current user store.

If this setting is not configured here, the setting from the .ini file is used.

If this setting is not configured here or in the .ini file, the user settings are still saved in the current user store.

If the path you configured here points to the same location as the "Path to user store" policy setting, this policy setting does not take effect.
```

Setting Name: `MigrateUserStore_Part`

Setting Value: `{Folder Path Where User Settings Were Saved}`

### Migration of existing profiles
Description: 
```
Applies to: file-based profile solution only

Profile management can migrate existing profiles "on the fly" during logon if the user has no profile in the user store.

The following event takes place during logon: if an existing Windows profile is found and the user does not yet have a Citrix user profile in the user store, the Windows profile is migrated (copied) to the user store on the fly. After this process, the user store profile is used by Profile management in the current and any other session configured with the path to the same user store.

If this setting is enabled, profile migration can be activated for roaming and local profiles (the default), roaming profiles only, local profiles only, or profile migration can be disabled altogether.

If profile migration is disabled and no Citrix user profile exists in the user store, the existing Windows mechanism for creating new profiles is used as in a setup without Profile management.

If this setting is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used.

If this setting is not configured here or in the .ini file, all types of existing profiles are migrated.
```

Setting Name: `MigrateWindowsProfilesToUserStore_Part`

Setting Value: `All`, `Local`, `Roaming`, `None`

### Minimum image quality
Description: 
```
Applies to: both file-based and container-based profile solutions

User environment variables cannot be used, except for %username% and %userdomain%.

If this setting is disabled, the path Windows\PM_CP is used.

If this setting is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used.

If this setting is not configured here or in the .ini file, the default value Windows\PM_CP is used.
```

Setting Name: `CPPathData`

Setting Value:  `{Path to the Cross-Platform Settings Store}`


### Path to log file
Description:
```
Sets an alternative path to which the log files are saved.

The path can point to a local drive or a remote, network-based one (a UNC path). Remote paths can be useful in large, distributed environments but they can create significant network traffic, which may be inappropriate for log files. For provisioned, virtual machines with a persistent hard drive, set a local path to that drive. This ensures log files are preserved when the machine restarts. For virtual machines without a persistent hard drive, setting a UNC path allows you to retain the log files but the system account for the machines must have write access to the UNC share. Use a local path for any laptops managed by the offline profiles feature.

Examples:
D:\LogFiles\ProfileManagement.
\\servername\LogFiles\ProfileManagement

If this setting is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used.

If this setting is not configured here or in the .ini file, the default location "%SystemRoot%\System32\Logfiles\UserProfileManager" is used.

If a UNC path is used for log files then Citrix recommends that an appropriate access control list is applied to the log file folder to ensure that only authorized user or computer accounts can access the stored files.
```

Setting Name: `DebugFilePath_Part`

Setting Value: `{Path to Log Files}`


### Path to the template profile:
Description:
```
By default, new user profiles are created from the default user profile on the computer where a user first logs on. Profile management can alternatively use a centrally stored template when creating new user profiles. Template profiles are identical to normal profiles in that they reside in any file share on the network. Use UNC notation to specifying paths to templates. Users need read access to a template profile.

If this setting is disabled, templates are not used.

If this setting is enabled, Profile management uses the template instead of the local default profile when creating new user profiles.

If a user has no Citrix user profile, but a local Windows user profile exists, by default the local profile is used (and migrated to the user store, if this is not disabled). This can be changed by enabling the setting "Template profile overrides local profile".

If this setting is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used.

If this setting is not configured here or in the .ini file, no template is used.
```

Setting Name: `TemplateProfilePath`

Setting Value: `{Path to Template Profile}`


### Path to user store
Description:
```
Sets the path to the directory in which the user settings (registry changes and synchronized files) are saved (user store).

The path can be an absolute UNC path or a path relative to the home directory.

In both cases, the following types of variables can be used: system environment variables enclosed in percent signs and attributes of the Active Directory user object enclosed in hashes.

Examples:
The folder Windows\%ProfileVer% stores the user settings in the subfolder called Windows\W2k3 of the user store (if %ProfileVer% is a system environment variable resolving to W2k3).

\\server\share\#SAMAccountName# stores the user settings to the UNC path \\server\share\JohnSmith (if #SAMAccountName# resolves to JohnSmith for the current user).

User environment variables cannot be used, except for %username% and %userdomain%.

If this setting is disabled, the user settings are saved in the Windows subdirectory of the home directory.

If this setting is not configured here, the setting from the .ini file is used.

If this setting is not configured here or in the .ini file, the Windows directory on the home drive is used.
```

Setting Name: `DATPath_Part`

Setting Value: `{Path to the User Store}`

### Personalized user information
Description:
```
Detailed log settings.

Define events or actions that Profile management logs in depth.

If this setting is not configured here, Profile management uses the settings from the .ini file.

If this setting is not configured here or in the .ini file, errors and general information are logged.
```

Setting Name: `LogLevel_UserName`

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```

### Pictures path
Description:
```
Lets you specify how to redirect the Pictures folder. To do so, select Enabled and then type the redirected path.
Caution: Potential data loss might occur. See below for details.
You might want to modify the path after the policy takes effect. However, consider potential data loss before you do so. The data contained in the redirected folder might be deleted if the modified path points to the same location as the previous path.
For example, suppose you specify the Contacts path as path1. Later, you change path1 to path2. If path1 and path2 point to the same location, all data contained in the redirected folder is deleted after the policy takes effect.
To avoid potential data loss, complete the following steps:
1. Apply Microsoft policy to machines where Profile Management is running through Active Directory Group Policy Objects. To do so, open the Group Policy Management Console, navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > File Explorer, and then enable Verify old and new Folder Redirection targets point to the same share before redirecting.
2. If applicable, apply hotfixes to machines where Profile Management is running. For details, see https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/977229 and https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2799904.
```

### Posture check for Citrix Workspace App
Description:
```
App Protection Posture Check

This allows you to block access to resources protected by App Protection unless they are on versions of Citrix Workspace App where the specific App Protection controls can be enforced.

Note: If this feature is applied, users on the Workspace app versions that do not support App Protection Posture Check will also be blocked from accessing protected sessions.
For more details on prerequisites and configuration refer to https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-workspace-app/app-protection/features.html#posture-check

Important considerations while creating new policy:
- Each entry should have only one capability.
- No space is allowed in the name of capability.
- Ensure the values are spelt correctly. Incorrectly spelt values will cause session disconnects.
```

Setting Name: `AppProtectionPostureCheck`

Setting Value:
```
jsonencode([
    {Posture Check 1},
    {Posture Check 2},
    ...
])
```


### Preferred color depth for simple graphics
Description:
```
This setting is available only on VDA versions XenApp and XenDesktop 7.6 Feature Pack 3 and later.

Allows lowering of the color depth at which simple graphics are sent to 8 or 16 bits per pixel, potentially improving responsiveness over low bandwidth connections, at the cost of a slight degradation of image quality. This option is supported only when a video codec is not used to compress graphics.

8-bit is only available for 7.12 VDAs and later. Setting 8-bit for 7.11 and earlier VDAs will result in those VDAs falling back to 24-bit.
```

Setting Name: `PreferredColorDepthForSimpleGraphics`

Setting Value: `ColorDepth8Bit`, `ColorDepth16Bit`, `ColorDepth24Bit`


### Preserve client drive letters
Description:
```

```

Setting Name: `ClientDriveLetterPreservation`

Related Settings:
```
Client drive redirection
```

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```


### Primary selection update mode
Description:
```
This setting is supported only by Linux VDA version 1.4 onwards.

PRIMARY selection is used for explicit copy/paste actions such as mouse selection and middle mouse button paste. This setting controls whether PRIMARY selection changes on the Linux VDA can be updated on the client's clipboard (and vice versa). It can include one of the following selection changes:

Selection changes are not updated on the client or the host. PRIMARY selection changes do not update a client's clipboard. Client clipboard changes do not update PRIMARY selection.

Host selection changes are not updated on the client. PRIMARY selection changes do not update a client's clipboard. Client clipboard changes update the PRIMARY selection.

Client selection changes are not updated on the host. PRIMARY selection changes update the client's clipboard. Client clipboard changes do not update the PRIMARY selection.

Selection changes are updated on both the client and host. PRIMARY selection change updates the client’s clipboard. Client clipboard changes update the PRIMARY selection.
```

Setting Name: `PrimarySelectionUpdateMode`

Setting Value: `AllUpdatesAllowed`, `UpdateToHostDenied`, `UpdateToClientDenied`, `AllUpdatesDenied`


### Printer assignments
Description:
```
Contains one or more entries, each specifying a default printer value, or session printers value, or both, for one or more clients. The default printer value specifies how the clients' default printer is established in an ICA session. The session printer value lists the network printers to be auto-created in the clients' ICA sessions.

When creating filters for a policy that contains this setting, include all clients specified in all entries in the setting.

By default, the client's current printer is used as the default printer for the session.

When setting the default printer value:
'Client main printer' allows the client's current default printer to be used as the default printer for the session.

'Generic Universal Printer' allows the Generic Universal printer to be used as the default printer for the session.

'PDF Printer' allows the PDF printer to be used as the default printer for the sessions using the the Citrix HTML or Chrome Receiver.

'Do not adjust' uses the current Terminal Services or Windows user profile setting for the default printer. If you choose this option, the default printer is not saved in the profile and it does not change according to other session or client properties. The default printer in a session will be the first printer auto-created in the session, which is either:

* The first printer added locally to the Windows server in Control Panel > Printers
* The first auto-created printer, if there are no printers added locally to the server
You can use this option to present users with the nearest printer through profile settings (known as Proximity Printing).

'<Not Set>' means that you are not changing the value set by the system or other policies. It equates to a 'Not Configured' state for that entry.

When policy settings are resolved, default printers applied by this setting take precedence over default printers applied by the 'Default printer' setting.

When setting the session printer value:

You can add printers to the list, edit the settings of a list entry, or remove printers from the list. You can apply customized settings for the current session at every logon. When printing polices are applied, session printers are merged into a single list: all printers applied in all policies that include a 'Printing Assignments' setting; and, all printers applied in policies that include a 'Session printer' setting.

Use individual 'Default printers' and 'Session printers' settings to set default behaviors for a farm, site, large group, or OU. Use the 'Printer assignments' setting to assign a large group of printers to multiple users.
```

Setting Name: `PrinterAssignments`

### Printer auto-creation event log preference
Description:
```
Specifies which events are logged during the printer auto-creation process. You can choose to log no errors or warnings, only errors, or errors and warnings. By default, errors and warnings are logged.
An example of a warning is an event in which a printer's native driver could not be installed and the universal printer driver is installed instead. To allow universal printer drivers to be used in this scenario, set the 'Universal print driver usage' setting to 'Use universal printing only' or 'Use universal printing only if requested driver is unavailable'.
```

Setting Name: `AutoCreationEventLogPreference`

Setting Value: `DoNotLog`, `LogErrorsOnly`, `LogErrorsAndWarnings`


### Printer driver mapping and compatibility
Description:
```
Lists driver substitution rules for auto-created client printers. When you define these rules, you can allow or prevent printers to be created with the specified driver. Additionally, you can allow created printers to use only universal printer drivers.
Driver substitution overrides (or maps) printer driver names the client provides, substituting an equivalent driver on the server. This gives server applications access to client printers that have the same drivers as the server but different driver names.

You can add a driver mapping, edit an existing mapping, override custom settings for a mapping, remove a mapping, or change the order of driver entries in the list. When adding a mapping, enter the client printer driver name and then select the server driver you want to substitute.
```

Setting Name: `PrinterDriverMappings`

Setting Value:
```
jsonencode([
    "{Driver Name 1},{Action 1}",
    "{Driver Name 2},{Action 2}",
])
""

Setting Value:
```
jsonencode([
    "Microsoft XPS Document Writer,Deny,Deny",
    "Send to Microsoft OneNote *,UPD_Only",
    "Printer Driver,Replace=Printer Driver Replaced",
    "Printer Driver Allowed,Allow",
])
""

Action Value Mapping:
Action Value | Comment
-- | --
`Deny,Deny` | Do not create
`UPD_Only` | Create with universal driver
`Replace={Replaced Driver Name}` | Replace with `Replaced Driver Name`
`Allow` | Allow

### Printer properties retention
Description:
```
Specifies whether and where to store printer properties. By default, the system determines whether printer properties are stored on the client device, if available, or in the user profile.

Select 'Held in profile only if not saved on client' to allow the system to determine where printer properties are stored. Printer properties are stored either on the client device, if available, or in the user profile. Although this option is the most flexible, it can also slow logon time and use extra bandwidth for system-checking.

Select 'Saved on the client device only' if your system has a mandatory or roaming profile that you do not save. Choose this option only if all the servers in your farm are running XenApp 5 and your users are using Citrix XenApp Plugin versions 9.x or later.

Select 'Retained in user profile only' if your system is constrained by bandwidth (this option reduces network traffic) and logon speed or your users use legacy plug-ins. This option stores printer properties in the user profile on the server and prevents any properties exchange with the client device. Use this option with MetaFrame Presentation Server 3.0 or earlier and MetaFrame Presentation Server Client 8.x or earlier. Note that this is applicable only if a Terminal Services roaming profile is used.
```

Setting Name: `PrinterPropertiesRetention`

Setting Value: `DoNotRetain`, `FallbackToProfile`, `RetainedInUserProfile`, `SavedOnClientDevice`


### Printer redirection bandwidth limit
Description:
```

```

Setting Value: `{Bandwidth Limit Percentage Value}`


### Process Internet cookie files on logoff
Description:
```
Some deployments leave extra Internet cookies that are not referenced by the file index.dat. The extra cookies left in the file system after sustained browsing can lead to profile bloat. Enable this setting to force processing of index.dat and remove the extra cookies. The setting might slightly increase logoff time. Enable this setting only when you experience the issue.

If this setting is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used.

If this setting is not configured here or in the .ini file, no processing of index.dat takes place.
```

Setting Name: `ProcessCookieFiles`

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```

### Profile container
Description:
```
By default, VHD containers allow concurrent access. With this setting enabled, they allow only one access at a time.

Note: Enabling this setting for profile containers in a container-based profile solution automatically disables the "Enable multi-session write-back for profile containers" setting.

If this policy is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used.

If this policy is not configured either here or in the .ini file, the setting is disabled.
```

Setting Name: `DisableConcurrentAccessToProfileContainer`

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```

### Profile container - List of folders to be contained in profile disk
Description:
```
A profile container is a VHDX based profile solution that lets you specify the folders to contain on the profile disk. The profile container attaches the profile disk containing those folders, thus eliminating the need to save a copy of the folders to the local profile. Doing so decreases logon times.

To use a profile container, enable this policy and add the relative paths of the folders to the list. Citrix recommends that you include the folders containing large cache files in the list. For example, add the Citrix Files content cache folder to the list: AppData\Local\Citrix\Citrix Files\PartCache

To enable a profile container for the entire user profile, add an asterisk (*) to the list. The following user profiles (if any) are automatically migrated to the container upon its first use:

- Local Windows user profile
- User profiles from the Citrix file-based profile solution

If this setting is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used. If this setting is configured neither here nor in the .ini file, it is disabled by default.
```

Setting Name: `ProfileContainer_Part`

Setting Value:
```
jsonencode([
    {Path 1},
    {Path 2}
])
```

### Redirection settings for AppData(Roaming)
Description:
```
Lets you specify how to redirect the AppData(Roaming) folder. To do so, select Enabled and then type the redirected path.
Caution: Potential data loss might occur. See below for details.
You might want to modify the path after the policy takes effect. However, consider potential data loss before you do so. The data contained in the redirected folder might be deleted if the modified path points to the same location as the previous path.
For example, suppose you specify the Contacts path as path1. Later, you change path1 to path2. If path1 and path2 point to the same location, all data contained in the redirected folder is deleted after the policy takes effect.
To avoid potential data loss, complete the following steps:
1. Apply Microsoft policy to machines where Profile Management is running through Active Directory Group Policy Objects. To do so, open the Group Policy Management Console, navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > File Explorer, and then enable Verify old and new Folder Redirection targets point to the same share before redirecting.

### Rendezvous proxy configuration
Description:
```
This setting allows configuring an explicit proxy for use with the Rendezvous protocol. If using a transparent proxy, this setting does not need to be enabled.

By default, this setting is disabled.

When disabled, the VDA will not route outbound traffic through any non-transparent proxies when trying to establish a Rendezvous connection with the Gateway Service.

When enabled, the VDA will attempt to establish a Rendezvous connection with the Gateway Service through the proxy defined in this setting.

The VDA supports using HTTP and SOCKS5 proxies for Rendezvous connections. To configure the VDA to use a proxy for the Rendezvous connection, you must enable this setting and specify either the proxy's address or the path to the PAC file.

For example:
Proxy address: "http://<URL or IP>:<port>" or "socks5://<URL or IP>:<port>"
PAC file: “http://<URL or IP>/<path>/<fileName>.pac”

NOTES:
1. EDT can only be proxied through SOCKS5 proxies. If using an HTTP proxy, you must use ICA over TCP.
2. Please refer to the product documentation for guidance on PAC file schema for SOCKS5 proxies.
3. VDA version 2103 is the minimum required for proxy configuration via PAC file.
```

Setting Name: `RendezvousProxy`

### Replicate user stores - Paths to replicate a user store
Description:
```
Lets you replicate a user store to multiple paths in addition to the path that the Path to user store policy specifies, on each logon and logoff. To synchronize to the user store files and folders modified during a session, enable active write back.

Starting with Profile Management version 2209, this feature is available for the full profile container. You can replicate the container to multiple paths. Replicated containers provide profile redundancy for user logon but not for in-session failover.

Note: Enabling the policy can increase system I/O and might prolong logoffs.

For Profile Management version 2112 or later, you can separate VHDX files from the replicated user store and store them to different paths. To do so, add the path for VHDX files after the path to the replicated user store, and separate the two paths with a vertical bar (|).
Example: \\path_a|\\path_b indicates that the user store (with VHDX files excluded) is stored in \\path_a and VHDX files are stored in \\path_b.
```

Setting Name: `MultiSiteReplication_Part`

Setting Value:
```
jsonencode([
    {Path 1},

### Secure HDX
Description:
```
Secure HDX uses application-level encryption to secure the ICA protocol and provide true End-to-End encryption for HDX sessions.

When disabled, Secure HDX is not used.

When enabled, Secure HDX is enforced, and connections to clients that do not support Secure HDX are blocked. Also, no network components in the path can parse HDX traffic, including NetScaler Gateway (HDX Insight).

When enabled for direct connections only, Secure HDX encrypts the ICA protocol for sessions where the client connects directly to the session host but is not used for sessions connected through a Gateway.
```

Setting Name: `SecureHDX`

Setting Value: `Disabled`, `Enabled`, `DirectConnectionsOnly`


### SecureICA minimum encryption level
Description:
```
Specifies the minimum level at which to encrypt session data sent between the server and a client device.

'Basic' encrypts the client connection using a non-RC5 algorithm. It protects the data stream from being read directly, but it can be decrypted. By default, the server uses Basic encryption for client-server traffic.

`LogOn`: 'RC5 (128 bit) logon only' encrypts the logon data with RC5 128-bit encryption and the client connection using Basic encryption.

`Bits40`: 'RC5 (40 bit)' encrypts the client connection with RC5 40-bit encryption.

`Bits56`: 'RC5 (56 bit)' encrypts the client connection with RC5 56-bit encryption.

`Bits128`: 'RC5 (128 bit)' encrypts the client connection with RC5 128-bit encryption.

The settings you specify for client-server encryption can interact with any other encryption settings in XenApp and your Windows operating system. If a higher priority encryption level is set on either a server or client device, settings you specify for published resources can be overridden.

You can raise encryption levels to further secure communications and message integrity for certain users. If a policy requires a higher encryption level, plug-ins using a lower encryption level are denied connection.

SecureICA does not perform authentication or check data integrity. To provide end-to-end encryption for your server farm, use SecureICA with TLS encryption.

SecureICA does not use FIPS-compliant algorithms. If this is an issue, configure the server and plug-ins to avoid using SecureICA.
```

    "{Printer Address 2},model={Shared Name 2},location={Location 2}",
    ...
])
```


### Session reliability connections
Description:
```
Allow or prevent session reliability connections.

Session Reliability keeps sessions active when network connectivity is interrupted. Users continue to see the application they are using until network connectivity resumes.

When connectivity is momentarily lost, the session remains active on the server. The user's display freezes and the cursor changes to a spinning hourglass until connectivity resumes. The user continues to access the display during the interruption and can resume interacting with the application when the network connection is restored. Session Reliability reconnects users without reauthentication prompts.

If you do not want users to be able to reconnect to interrupted sessions without having to reauthenticate, configure the Auto client reconnect authentication setting to require authentication. Users are then prompted to reauthenticate when reconnecting to interrupted sessions.

If you use both Session Reliability and Auto Client Reconnect, the two features work in sequence. Session Reliability closes, or disconnects, the user session after the amount of time you specify in the Session reliability timeout setting. After that, the settings you configure for Auto Client Reconnect take effect, attempting to reconnect the user to the disconnected session.
```

Setting Name: `SessionReliabilityConnections`

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```


### Session reliability port number
Description:
```
TCP port number for incoming session reliability connections.
```

Setting Name: `SessionReliabilityPort`

Setting Value: `{TCP Port Number}`


### Session reliability timeout
Description:
```
The length of time in seconds the session reliability proxy waits for a client to reconnect before allowing the session to be disconnected.

The default length of time is 180 seconds, or three minutes. Though you can extend the amount of time a session is kept open, this feature is designed to be convenient to the user and it does not prompt the user for reauthentication. If you extend the amount of time a session is kept open indiscriminately, chances increase that a user may get distracted and walk away from the client device, potentially leaving the session accessible to unauthorized users.

If you do not want users to be able to reconnect to interrupted sessions without having to reauthenticate, configure the Auto client reconnect authentication setting to require authentication. Users are then prompted to reauthenticate when reconnecting to interrupted sessions.

If you use both Session Reliability and Auto Client Reconnect, the two features work in sequence. Session Reliability closes, or disconnects, the user session after the amount of time you specify in the Session reliability timeout setting. After that, the settings you configure for Auto Client Reconnect take effect, attempting to reconnect the user to the disconnected session.
```

Setting Name: `SessionReliabilityTimeout`

Setting Value: `{Timeout in Seconds}`


### Session watermark style
Description:
```
Controls the style of session watermark text labels.

This policy is only effective when session watermark is enabled.

With Multiple configuration, five watermark labels will be displayed in the session, with one in the center and four in the corners.

With Single configuration, a single watermark text label will displayed at the center of the session.
```

Setting Name: `WatermarkStyle`

Setting Value: `StyleSingle`, `StyleMultiple`


### Set priority order for user groups
Description:
```
Specify the priority order for user groups. The order determines which group takes precedence when a user belongs to multiple groups with different policy settings. In the Priority order for user groups field, enter the Security Identifiers (SIDs) or domain names of the groups in descending order of priority, separated by semicolons (;).

Example:
ctxxa.local\groupb;S-1-5-21-674278408-26188528-2146851469-1174;ctxxa.local\groupc;

When a user belongs to multiple groups with different policy settings, consider the following:

- If the user belongs to one or more groups defined in this policy, the group with the highest priority takes precedence.

- If the user doesn't belong to any of the groups defined in this policy, the group with the SID listed earliest in alphabetical order takes precedence.

If this setting is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used.

If this setting is configured neither here nor in the .ini file, no priority order is specified.
```

Setting Name: `OrderedGroups_Part`

Setting Value: `{UserGroup1};{UserGroup2};...`


### Source for creating cross-platform settings
Description:
```
Default: `false`

Definition files contain a set of definitions that configure an application. If the cross-platform settings store contains a definition with no data, or the cached data in the single-platform profile is newer than the definition's data in the store, Profile management only migrates the data from the single-platform profile to the store if you enable this setting.
```

This setting prevents any objects filtered through a policy from having Special Folder Redirection, regardless of settings that exist elsewhere. When this setting is set to 'Prohibited', any related settings specified for Web Interface or Citrix Receiver are ignored.

To define which users can have special folder redirection, select 'Allowed' and include this setting in a policy filtered on the users you want to have this feature. This setting overrides all other special folder redirection settings throughout XenApp.

Because Special Folder Redirection must interact with the client device, settings that prevent users from accessing or saving files to their local hard drives also prevent Special Folder Redirection from working.

For seamless applications and seamless and published desktops, Special Folder Redirection works for Documents and Desktops folders. Citrix does not recommend using Special Folder Redirection with published Windows Explorer.

### SSL Universal Print Server encrypted print data stream (CGP) port
Description:
```
Applies to Universal Print Server

Specifies the TCP port number used by the Universal Print Client when connecting to the Universal Print Server's encrypted print data stream (CGP) listener.
The Universal Print Server is an optional component that enables the use of Citrix's universal print drivers for network printing scenarios. When Universal Print Server is used, printing commands are sent from XenApp and XenDesktop hosts to the Universal Print Server via SOAP over HTTP (or HTTPS). However bulk print data streams are delivered to the print server on separate TCP connections using Common Gateway Protocol (CGP). This setting modifies the TCP port to which the Universal Print Client sends encrypted CGP connections (i.e., outbound print jobs).
```

Setting Name: `UpcSslCgpPort`

Setting Value: `{Port Number}`


### SSL Universal Print Server encrypted web service (HTTPS/SOAP) port
Description:
```
Specifies the TCP port number used by the Universal Print Client when connecting to the Universal Print Server's encrypted web service (HTTPS/SOAP) listener. The Universal Print Server is an optional component that enables the use of Citrix universal print drivers for network printing scenarios. When the Universal Print Server is used, printing commands are sent from XenApp and XenDesktop hosts to the Universal Print Server via SOAP over HTTPS. This setting modifies the TCP port to which the Universal Print Client will send HTTPS/SOAP requests. The default value is 8443.

You must configure both host and print server HTTPS port identically . If you do not configure the ports identically, the host software will not connect to the Universal Print Server. This setting changes the VDA on XenApp and XenDesktop. In addition, you must change the default port on the Universal Print Server. For more information, refer to the product documentation.
```

Setting Name: `UpcSslHttpsPort`

Setting Value: `{Port Number}`


### Start Menu path
Description:
```
Lets you specify how to redirect the Start Menu folder. To do so, select Enabled and then type the redirected path.
Caution: Potential data loss might occur. See below for details.
You might want to modify the path after the policy takes effect. However, consider potential data loss before you do so. The data contained in the redirected folder might be deleted if the modified path points to the same location as the previous path.
For example, suppose you specify the Contacts path as path1. Later, you change path1 to path2. If path1 and path2 point to the same location, all data contained in the redirected folder is deleted after the policy takes effect.
To avoid potential data loss, complete the following steps:
1. Apply Microsoft policy to machines where Profile Management is running through Active Directory Group Policy Objects. To do so, open the Group Policy Management Console, navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > File Explorer, and then enable Verify old and new Folder Redirection targets point to the same share before redirecting.
2. If applicable, apply hotfixes to machines where Profile Management is running. For details, see https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/977229 and https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2799904.

### Template profile overrides local profile
Description:
```
By default, new user profiles are created from the default user profile on the computer where a user first logs on. Profile management can alternatively use a centrally stored template when creating new user profiles. Template profiles are identical to normal profiles in that they reside in any file share on the network. Use UNC notation to specifying paths to templates. Users need read access to a template profile.

If this setting is disabled, templates are not used.

If this setting is enabled, Profile management uses the template instead of the local default profile when creating new user profiles.

If a user has no Citrix user profile, but a local Windows user profile exists, by default the local profile is used (and migrated to the user store, if this is not disabled). This can be changed by enabling the setting "Template profile overrides local profile".

If this setting is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used.

If this setting is not configured here or in the .ini file, no template is used.

```
jsonencode([
    {Driver 1},
    {Driver 2},
    ...
])
```

### Universal print driver usage
Description:
```
Specifies when to use universal printing. Universal printing employs generic printer drivers instead of standard model-specific drivers potentially simplifying burden of driver management on host machines. The availability of a universal print driver depends upon capabilities of client, host, and print server software. In some certain configurations, universal printing may not be available. By default, universal printing is used only if the requested driver is unavailable.

`FallbackToSpecific`: 'Use universal printing only if requested driver is unavailable' uses standard model specific drivers for printer creation if they are available. If a requested driver model is not available, the system will attempt to create the printer with a universal driver.

`SpecificOnly`: 'Use only printer model specific drivers' specifies that the printers should not be created with a universal driver. If the requested driver model is unavailable, the printer will not be created.

`UpdOnly`: 'Use universal printing only' specifies that only universal drivers should be used to create printers. If a suitable universal driver universal printing is not available, then the printer will not be created.

`FallbackToUpd`: 'Use printer model specific drivers only if universal printing is unavailable' employs a universal printer driver if it is available. If a suitable universal driver is not available, the printer may still be created with requested driver model if it is available.
```

### Universal Print Server web service (HTTP/SOAP) connect timeout
Description:
```
Specifies the number of seconds that the Universal Print Client should wait until a Universal Print Server web service connect() operation times out.
```

Setting Name: `UpcHttpConnectTimeout`

Setting Value: `{Timeout in Seconds}`


### Universal Print Server web service (HTTP/SOAP) port
Description:
```
Specifies the TCP port number used by the Universal Print Server's web service (HTTP/SOAP) listener. The Universal Print Server is an optional component that enables the use of Citrix universal print drivers for network printing scenarios. When the Universal Print Server is used, printing commands are sent from XenApp and XenDesktop hosts to the Universal Print Server via SOAP over HTTP. This setting modifies the default TCP port on which the Universal Print Server listens for incoming HTTP/SOAP requests. The default value is 8080.

You must configure both host and print server HTTP port identically . If you do not configure the ports identically, the host software will not connect to the Universal Print Server. This setting changes the VDA on XenApp and XenDesktop. In addition, you must change the default port on the Universal Print Server. For more information, refer to the product documentation.
```

Setting Name: `UpsHttpPort`

Setting Value: `{Port Number}`


### Universal Print Server web service (HTTP/SOAP) receive timeout

### Universal Print Servers for load balancing
Description:
```
Lists the Universal Print Servers to be used to load balance printer connections established at session launch, after evaluating other Citrix printing policy settings. To optimize printer creation time, Citrix recommends that all print servers have the same set of the shared printers.

This setting also implements print server failover detection and printer connection recovery. The print servers are checked periodically for availability. If a server failure is detected, that server is removed from the load balancing scheme, and printer connections on that server are redistributed among other available print servers. When the failed print server recovers, it is returned to the load balancing scheme.
```

Setting Name: `LoadBalancedPrintServers`

Setting Value:
```
jsonencode([
    {Server 1},
    {Server 2},
    ...
])
```

### Universal Print Servers out-of-service threshold
Description:
```
Specifies the number of seconds the load balancer waits for an unavailable Universal Print Server to recover before it assumes the server is offline. That server's load is then redistributed among other available print servers.
```

Setting Name: `PrintServersOutOfServiceThreshold`

Setting Value: `{Threshold in Seconds}`


### Universal printing EMF processing mode
Description:
```
Controls the method of processing the EMF spool file on the Windows client machine. When using the Citrix Universal Printer driver, the system spools the EMF records on the host and delivers the EMF spool file to the Windows client for processing. Typically, these EMF spool files are injected directly to the client's spool queue. For printers and drivers that are compatible with the EMF format, this is the fastest printing method. However, some drivers may require the EMF spool file to be reprocessed and sent through the GDI subsystem on the client. Normally, this alternate print path is selected automatically. However, since it is not always possible to detect such printers and drivers automatically, this setting can be used to force the EMF spool file to be reprocessed and sent through the GDI subsystem on the client.
```

Setting Name: `EMFProcessingMode`

Setting Value: `ReprocessEMFsForPrinter`, `SpoolDirectlyToPrinter`


### Universal printing image compression limit
Description:
```

By default, the image compression limit is set to 'Best quality (lossless compression).' If 'No compression' is selected, compression is disabled for EMF printing only. Compression is not disabled for XPS printing.

When adding this setting to a policy that includes the 'Universal printing optimization defaults' setting, be aware of the following items:

* If the compression level in the 'Universal printing compression limit' setting is lower than the level defined in 'Universal printing optimization defaults' setting, images are compressed at the level defined in the 'Universal printing compression limits' setting.
* If compression is disabled, the 'Desired image quality' and 'Enable heavyweight compression' options of the 'Universal printing optimization defaults' setting have no effect in the policy.
```

Setting Name: `ImageCompressionLimit`

Setting Value: `NoCompression`, `LosslessCompression`, `MinimumCompression`, `MediumCompression`, `MaximumCompression`

### Universal printing optimization defaults
Description:
```
Specifies the default settings when the Universal Printer is created for a session.

* Desired image quality - Sets the image compression level (EMF, XPS, PDF).
* Enable heavyweight compression - Reduces bandwidth beyond the 'Desired image quality' level without losing image quality (EMF only).
* Allow caching of embedded images - (EMF only).
* Allow caching of embedded fonts - (EMF and PDF). - For the PDF driver, this enables standard and licensed font embedding by default.
* Allow non-administrators to modify these settings - Allows non-administrators to modify these options through the driver's advanced print settings (EMF and PDF).

The value is a set of a key-value pairs separated by commas. The default value of this setting is 'ImageCompression=StandardQuality, HeavyweightCompression=False, ImageCaching=True, FontCaching=True, AllowNonAdminsToModify=False'

When entering the value on a command line, follow the format as specified in the default value above.

Please consult the product documentation for more information about this setting.
```

jsonencode([
    {URL 1},
    {URL 2},
    ...
])
```

### Use asynchronous writes
Description:
```
Enables or disables asynchronous disk writes. By default, asynchronous writes are disabled.

Asynchronous disk writes can improve the speed of file transfers and writing to client disks over WANs, which are typically characterized by relatively high bandwidth and high latency. However, if there is a connection or disk fault, the client file or files being written may end in an undefined state. If this happens, a pop-up window informs the user of the files affected. The user can then take remedial action, such as restarting an interrupted file transfer on reconnection or when the disk fault is corrected.

Citrix recommends enabling asynchronous disk writes only for users who need remote connectivity with good file access speed and who can easily recover files or data lost in the event of connection or disk failure. When enabling this setting, make sure that the 'Client drive redirection' setting is enabled. If this setting is disabled, asynchronous writes will not occur.
```

Setting Name: `AsynchronousWrites`

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```

Description:
```
Determines the time zone setting of the user session. When enabled, the administrator can choose to default the user session’s time zone settings to that of the user's time zone settings.

On XenDesktop: By default, the user session's time zone is used for the session. 'Use Client Time Zone' will be in effect if this policy is not active or 'Use default value' is checked.

On XenApp or XenDesktop VDA Server OS: By default, the server's time zone is used for the session. For this setting to be enforced, enable the 'Allow time zone redirection' setting in the Remote Desktop Services node of the Group Policy Management Console.
```

Setting Name: `SessionTimeZone`

Setting Value: `UseServerTimeZone`, `UseClientTimeZone`

### Use video codec for compression
Description:
```
This setting is available only on VDA versions XenApp and XenDesktop 7.6 Feature Pack 3 and later.

Allows use of a video codec to compress graphics when video decoding is available on the endpoint. When 'For the entire screen' is chosen the video codec will be applied as the default codec for all content (some small images and text will be optimized and sent losslessly). When 'For actively changing regions' is selected the video codec will be used for areas where there is constant change on the screen, other data will use still image compression and bitmap caching. When video decoding is not available on the endpoint, or when you specify 'Do not use', a combination of still image compression and bitmap caching is used. When 'Use when preferred' is selected, the system chooses, based on various factors. The results may vary between versions as the selection method is enhanced.

Select 'DoNotUseVideoCodec' to optimize for server CPU load and for cases that do not have a lot of server-rendered video or other graphically intense applications.

Select 'UseVideoCodecIfAvailable' to optimize for cases with heavy use of server-rendered video and 3D graphics, especially in low bandwidth.

Select 'ActivelyChangingRegions' to optimize for improved video performance, especially in low bandwidth, while maintaining scalability for static and slowly changing content.

Select 'UseVideoCodecIfPreferred' to allow the system to make its best effort to choose appropriate settings for the current scenario.
```

Setting Name: `UseVideoCodecForCompression`

Setting Value: `DoNotUseVideoCodec`, `UseVideoCodecIfAvailable`, `ActivelyChangingRegions`, `UseVideoCodecIfPreferred`

Lets you specify how to redirect the Videos folder. To do so, select Enabled and then type the redirected path.
Caution: Potential data loss might occur. See below for details.
You might want to modify the path after the policy takes effect. However, consider potential data loss before you do so. The data contained in the redirected folder might be deleted if the modified path points to the same location as the previous path.
For example, suppose you specify the Contacts path as path1. Later, you change path1 to path2. If path1 and path2 point to the same location, all data contained in the redirected folder is deleted after the policy takes effect.
To avoid potential data loss, complete the following steps:
1. Apply Microsoft policy to machines where Profile Management is running through Active Directory Group Policy Objects. To do so, open the Group Policy Management Console, navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > File Explorer, and then enable Verify old and new Folder Redirection targets point to the same share before redirecting.
2. If applicable, apply hotfixes to machines where Profile Management is running. For details, see https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/977229 and https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2799904.
```

### Virtual channel allow list
Description:
```
Enables the use of an allow list that specifies which virtual channels are allowed to be opened in an ICA session.

When disabled, all virtual channels are allowed.

When enabled, only Citrix virtual channels are allowed. To use custom or third-party virtual channels with this feature, the virtual channels must be added to the list. To add a virtual channel to the list, enter the virtual channel name, followed by a comma, and the path to the process that accesses the virtual channel. Additional executable paths can be listed and the paths are separated by commas.

Examples:
CTXCVC1,C:\VC1\vchost.exe
CTXCVC2,C:\VC2\vchost.exe,C:\Program Files\Third Party\vcaccess.exe
```

Setting Name: `VirtualChannelWhiteList`

Setting Value:
```
jsonencode([
    "{Virtual Channel Name 1},{App Path 1}",
    "{Virtual Channel Name 2},{App Path 2}",
    ...
])
```

### Virtual channel allow list log throttling
Description:
```
This setting determines the throttle time for logging events for a session. Events for each virtual channel configured in virtual channel allow list are throttled for the duration specified in this setting. The throttle timer will be reset upon disconnect/logoff.
```

Setting Name: `VirtualChannelWhiteListLogThrottling`

Setting Value: `{Throttle Time in Hours}`

### Virtual channel allow list logging
Description:
```
Disabled: disables logging events to event viewer for custom virtual channels
Log warnings only: logs warning events to event viewer for custom virtual channels that are not in the virtual channel allow list
Log all events: logs all events to event viewer for custom virtual channels
```

Setting Name: `VirtualChannelWhiteListLogging`

Setting Value: `Disabled`, `LogWarningsOnly` `LogAllEvents`

### Virtual IP loopback support
Description:
```
Allows each session to have its own virtual loopback address for communication. Configure list of programs via the 'Virtual IP virtual loopback programs list' policy.
```

Setting Name: `VirtualLoopbackSupport`

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```

### Virtual IP virtual loopback programs list
Description:
```
Allows each session to have its own virtual loopback address for communication. You must enable the policy 'Virtual IP loopback support' for this setting to take effect.
```

Setting Name: `VirtualLoopbackPrograms`

Setting Value:
```
jsonencode([
    {Program Path 1},
    {Program Path 2},
    ...
])
```

### Visual quality
Description:
```
The desired visual quality of the images. Higher visual quality will result in increased bandwidth usage. For improved responsiveness in constrained bandwidth scenarios use lower visual quality. By default medium quality is selected.

In cases where preserving image data is vital (for example, when displaying X-ray images where no loss of quality is acceptable), Always lossless should be selected, to assure no lossy data is ever sent. Build to lossless may send lossy images when there are cases of high activity, but will improve quality to lossless once activity ceases.

If 'Always lossless' or 'Build to lossless' is selected, the effect of this setting is changed if the 'Allow visually lossless compression' setting is configured and set to true. In this case, visually lossless compression is used instead of true lossless compression. 'Always lossless' is then always visually lossless and 'Build to lossless' is then build to visually lossless. For more information on true lossless vs. visually lossless, see the help for 'Allow visually lossless compression' setting.

Setting Name: `VisualQuality`

Setting Value: `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `BuildToLossless`, `AlwaysLossless`

### Wait for printers to be created (server desktop)
Description:
```
Allows or prevents a delay in connecting to a session so that desktop printers can be auto-created. By default, a connection delay does not occur. This setting applies only to published server desktops.
```

Setting Name: `WaitForPrintersToBeCreated`

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```

### Watermark custom text
Description:
```
Custom text that is displayed in watermark text labels. It should not exceed 25 characters, otherwise it will be truncated.

Additional customization can be achieved using custom text policy from CVAD version 2206 onwards. These customizations can be achieved by using custom tags in the text. Max number of characters is increased to 1024.

These are available tags for watermark settings:

<font=value> - change font of watermark text. value is name of a font available on the VDA. example: <font=Courier New>
<fontzoom=value> - font zoom factor. value will be 200 for 200% zoom on watermark text. example: <fontzoom=200>
<position=value> - change position of watermark text. value can be center, topleft, topright, bottomleft, bottomright. only applicable with single style. example: <position=topright>
<rotation=value> - rotate watermark text. value is in degree and can be between -360 and 360. example: <rotation=45>
<style=value> - change display style. value can be single, xstyle, tile. This tag will override WatermarkStyle policy. example: <style=single>

With single style configuration, a single watermark text label will be displayed at the center of the session, position tag can be used to change the location. With xstyle configuration, five watermark labels will be displayed in the session, with one in the center and four in the corners. With tile configuration, multiple labels will be displayed in session, watermark will be equally spaced on the entire screen.

These are available tags for changing watermark text:

<username> - user name
<domain> - domain name of logged in user account
<hostname> - machine name of VDA
<clientip> - ip address of end point
<serverip> - ip address of VDA
<date> - date when the session was established
<time> - time when the session was established
<newline> - create next line

If tags for watermark text are used then all other watermark policy related to text will be ignored.

Examples:

1. change font of default text
<font=Courier New>
2. show only username with 200% zoom
<username><fontzoom=200>
3. show username in first line and date in second line using "Consolas" font
<username><newline><date><font=Consolas>

Tags for watermark settings can be used with other watermark policies. Unsupported tags will be shown as regular text.

Watermark text should not exceed 25 characters.

```

Setting Name: `WatermarkCustomText`

Setting Value: `{Watermark Text}`

### Watermark transparency
Description:
```

```

Setting Name: `AllowWIARedirection`

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```

### Windows Media client-side content fetching
Description:
```
This setting enables a user device to stream multimedia files directly from the source provider on the Internet or Intranet, rather than through the host server.

By default, the streaming of multimedia files to the user device direct from the source provider is allowed.

Allowing this setting improves network utilization and server scalability by moving any processing on the media from the host server to the user device. It also removes the requirement that an advanced multimedia framework such as Microsoft DirectShow or Media Foundation be installed on the user device; the user device requires only the ability to play a file from a URL.

When adding this setting to a policy, make sure the Windows Media Redirection setting is present and set to Allowed. If this setting is disabled, the streaming of multimedia files to the user device direct from the source provider is also disabled.
```

Setting Name: `MultimediaAccelerationEnableCSF`

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```

### Windows Media fallback prevention
Description:
```
This setting is available only on VDA versions XenApp and XenDesktop 7.6 Feature Pack 3 and later.

Specify the video load management as the following:

`Unconfigured`: 'Not Configured' - equivalent to 'Play all content': if you do not configure this policy setting, the 'Play all content' methods are used.

`SFSR`: 'Play all content' - attempt client-side content fetching, then Windows Media Redirection. If unsuccessful, play on server.

`SFCR`: 'Play all content only on client' - attempt client-side fetching, then Windows Media Redirection. If unsuccessful, content will not play.

`CFCR`: 'Play only client-accessible content on client' - attempt only client-side fetching. If unsuccessful, content will not play.
```

Setting Name: `VideoLoadManagement`

Setting Value: `CFCR`, `SFCR`, `SFSR`, `Unconfigured`

### Windows Media redirection
Description:
```
Controls and optimizes the way Virtual Apps servers deliver streaming audio and video to users. By default, this setting is allowed.

Allowing this setting increases the quality of audio and video rendered from the server to a level that compares with audio and video played locally on a client device. Virtual Apps streams multimedia to the client in the original, compressed form and allows the client device to decompress and render the media.

Windows Media Redirection optimizes multimedia files that are encoded with codecs that adhere to Microsoft's DirectShow, DirectX Media Objects, and Media Foundation standards. To play back a given multimedia file, a codec compatible with the encoding format of the multimedia file must be present on the client device.

By default, audio is disabled on Citrix Receiver. To allow users to run multimedia applications in ICA sessions, turn on audio or give the users permission to turn on audio themselves in their plug-in interface.

Choose 'Prohibited' only if playing media using Windows Media Redirection sounds worse than when rendered using basic ICA compression and regular audio. This is rare but can happen under low bandwidth conditions; for example, with media in which there is a very low frequency of key frames.
```

Setting Name: `MultimediaAcceleration`

Setting Value:
```
{
    enabled = true | false
}
```
